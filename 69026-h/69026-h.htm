<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>This volume consists of articles and monographs upon the
Latin Orient and Balkan history, published between 1897 and
the present year. For kind permission to reprint them in collected
form I am indebted to the editors and proprietors of <i>The Quarterly
Review</i>, <i>The English Historical Review</i>, <i>The Journal of Hellenic
Studies</i>, <i>Die Byzantinische Zeitschrift</i>, <i>The Westminster Review</i>, <i>The
Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, and <i>The Journal of the British and American
Archæological Society of Rome</i>. All the articles have been revised
and brought up to date by the light of recent research in a field
of history which is no longer neglected in either the Near East
or Western Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>From the Roman conquest in 146 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Greece lost her independence
for a period of nearly two thousand years. During twenty centuries
the country had no separate existence as a nation, but followed the
fortunes of foreign rulers. Attached, first to Rome and then to Constantinople,
it was divided among various Latin nobles after the fall
of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, and succumbed to the Turks in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. From that time, with the exception
of the brief Venetian occupation of the Peloponnese, and the long
foreign administration of the Ionian Islands, it remained an integral
part of the Turkish Empire till the erection of the modern Greek kingdom.
Far too little attention has been paid to the history of Greece
under foreign domination, for which large materials have been collected
since Finlay wrote his great work. Yet, even in the darkest hours of
bondage, the annals of Greece can scarcely fail to interest the admirers
of ancient Hellas.</p>

<p>The victorious Romans treated the vanquished Greeks with moderation,
and their victory was regarded by the masses as a relief from the
state of war which was rapidly consuming the resources of the taxpayers.
Satisfied to forego the galling symbols, provided that they held the
substance, of power in their own hands, the conquerors contented
themselves with dissolving the Achaian League, with destroying,
perhaps from motives of commercial policy, the great mart of Corinth,
and with subordinating the Greek communities to the governor of
the Roman province of Macedonia, who exercised supreme supervision
over them. But these local bodies were allowed to preserve their
formal liberties; Corfù, the first of Greek cities to submit to Rome,
always remained autonomous, and Athens and Sparta enjoyed special
immunities as “the allies of Rome,” while the sacred character of
Delphi secured for it practical autonomy. A few years after the conquest
the old Leagues were permitted to revive, at least in name; and the
land tax, payable by most of the communities to the Roman Government,
seemed to fulfil the expectation of the natives that their fiscal
burdens would be diminished under foreign rule. The historian Polybios<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
who successfully pleaded the cause of his countrymen at this great
crisis in their history, has contrasted the purity of Roman financial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
administration with the corruption of Greek public men, and has cited
a saying current in Greece soon after the conquest: “If we had not
perished quickly, we should not have been saved.” While this was the
popular view, the large class of landed proprietors was also pleased
by the recognition of its social position by its new masters, and the
men who were entrusted with the delicate task of organising the
conquered country at the outset of its new career wisely availed themselves
of the disinterested services of Polybios, who enjoyed the confidence
of both Greeks and Romans. Even Mummius himself, the
destroyer of Corinth, if he carried off many fine statues to deck his
triumph, left behind him the memory of his gentleness to the weak,
as well as that of his firmness to the strong, and might have been
taken as the embodiment of those qualities which Virgil, more than
a century later, held up to the imitation of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The <i>pax Romana</i>, which the Roman conquest seemed likely to
confer upon the jealous Greeks, was occasionally broken in the early
decades of the new administration. The sacred isle of Delos, which was
then subordinate to Athens, and which had become the greatest mart
for merchandise and slaves in the Levant since the destruction of Corinth,
and the silver-mines of Laurion, which had of old provided the sinews
of naval warfare against the Persian host, were the scenes of servile
insurrections such as that which about the same time raged in Sicily,
and a democratic rising at Dyme not far from Patras called for repression.
But the participation of many Greeks in the quarrel between
Rome and Mithridates, King of Pontus, entailed far more serious
consequences upon their country. While the warlike Cretans, who had
not bowed as yet beneath the Roman yoke, sent their redoubtable
archers to serve in his ranks, the Athenians were seduced from their
allegiance by the rhetoric of their fellow-citizen, Athenion, or Aristion,
a man of dubious origin, who had found the profession of philosopher
so paying that he was now able to indulge in that of a patriot. Appointed
captain of the city, he established a reign of terror, and included the
Roman party and his own philosophic rivals in the same proscription.
He despatched the bibliophile Apellikon, who had purchased the
library of Aristotle, with an expedition against Delos, which failed;
but a similar attempt by the Pontic forces was successful, and the
prosperity of the island was almost ruined by their ravages. When
the armies of Mithridates reached the mainland, there was a great
rising against the Romans, and for the second time the plain of
Chaironeia witnessed a battle, which on this occasion, however, was
indecisive. A great change now took place in the fortunes of the war.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Sulla arrived in Greece, routed the Athenian philosopher and his
Pontic colleague in a single battle, cowed most of the Greeks by the
mere terror of his name, and laid siege to Athens and the Piræus,
which offered a vigorous resistance. The groves of the Academy and
the Lyceum furnished the timber for his battering rams; the treasuries
of the most famous temples, those of Delphi, Olympia and Epidauros,
provided pay for his soldiers; the remains of the famous “long walls,”
which had united Athens with her harbour, were converted into siegeworks.
The knoll near the street of tombs, on which a tiny church
now stands, is supposed to be part of Sulla’s mound, and the bones
found there those of his victims. An attempt to relieve the besieged
failed; and, as their provisions grew scarce, the Athenians lost heart
and sought to obtain favourable terms from the enemy. In the true
Athenian spirit, they prayed for consideration on the ground that their
ancestors had fought at Marathon. But the practical Roman replied
that he had “not come to study history, but to chastise rebels<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,” and
insisted on unconditional surrender. In 86 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Athens was taken by
assault, and many of the inhabitants were butchered; but, in spite of
his indifference to the glories of Marathon, the conqueror consented
to spare the fabric of the city for the sake of its ancient renown. The
Akropolis, where Aristion had taken refuge, still held out, and the
Odeion of Perikles, which stood at the south-east corner of it, perished
by fire in the siege. Want of water at last forced the garrison to surrender,
and the evacuation of the Piræus by the Pontic commander made
Sulla master of that important position also. To the Piræus he showed
as little mercy as Mummius had shown to Corinth. While from Athens
he carried off nothing except a few columns of the temple of Zeus
Olympios, a large sum of money which he found in the treasury of the
Parthenon, and a fine manuscript of Aristotle and Theophrastos, he
levelled the Piræus with the ground, and inflicted upon it a punishment
from which it did not recover till the time of Constantine. Then he
marched to Chaironeia, where another battle ended in the rout of the
Pontic army, and the Thebans atoned for their rebellion by the loss
of half their territory, which the victor consecrated to the temples of
Delphi and Olympia as compensation for what he had taken from them.
A fresh Pontic defeat at Orchomenos in Bœotia ended the war upon
Greek soil, but the struggle long left its mark upon the country. Athens
still retained her privileges, and the Cappadocian King Ariobarzanes II,
Philopator and his son, restored the Odeion of Perikles<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, but many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of her citizens had died in the siege, and the rival armies had inflicted
enormous injuries on Attica and Bœotia, the chief theatre of the war.
Some small towns never recovered, and Thebes sank into a state of
insignificance from which she did not emerge for centuries.</p>

<p>The pirates continued the work of destruction, which the first
Mithridatic war had begun. The geographical configuration of the
Ægean coasts has always been favourable to that ancient scourge of
the Levant, and the conclusion of peace between Rome and the Pontic
king let loose upon society a number of adventurers, whose occupation
had ceased with the war. The inhabitants of Cilicia and Crete excelled
above all others in the practice of this lucrative profession, and many
were their depredations upon the Greek shores and islands. One pirate
captain destroyed the sanctuaries of Delos and carried off the whole
population into slavery; two others defeated the Roman admiral in
Cretan waters. This last disgrace resulted in the conquest of that fine
island by the Roman proconsul Quintus Metellus, whose difficult task
fully earned him the title of “Creticus.” The islanders fought with the
desperate courage which they have evinced in all ages. Beaten in the
open, they retired behind the walls of Kydonia and Knossos, and when
those places fell, a guerilla warfare went on in the mountains, until
at last Crete surrendered, and the last vestige of Greek freedom in
Europe disappeared in the guise of a Roman province. Meanwhile,
Pompey had swept the pirates from the seas, and established a colony
of those marauders at Dyme, the scene of the previous rebellion<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
Neither before nor since has piracy been put down with such thoroughness
in the Levant, and Greece enjoyed, for a time at least, a welcome
immunity from its ravages.</p>

<p>But the administration of the provinces in the last century of the
Roman Republic often pressed very heavily upon the unfortunate
provincials. Even after making due deduction for professional exaggeration
from the charges brought by Cicero against extortionate governors,
there remains ample evidence of their exactions. The notorious Verres,
the scourge of Sicily, though he only passed through Greece, levied
blackmail upon Sikyon and plundered the treasury of the Parthenon,
and bad governors of Macedonia, like Caius Antonius and Piso, had
greater opportunities for making money at the expense of the Greeks.
As Juvenal complained at a later period, even when these scoundrels
were brought to justice on their return home, their late province gained
nothing by their punishment, and Caius Antonius, in exile on Cephalonia,
treated that island as if it were his private property. The Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
money-lenders had begun, too, to exploit the financial necessities of
the Greeks, and even so ardent a Philhellene as Cicero’s correspondent,
Atticus, who owed his name to his long sojourn at Athens and to his
interest in everything Attic, lent money to the people of Sikyon on
such ruinous terms that they had to sell their pictures to pay off the
debt. Athens, deprived of her commercial resources since the siege
by Sulla, resorted to the sale of her coveted citizenship, much as
some modern States sell titles, and subsisted mainly on the reputation
of her schools of philosophy. It became the fashion for young Romans
of promise to study there; thus Cicero spent six months there and
revisited the city on his way to and from his Cilician governorship,
and Horace tells us that he tried “to seek the truth among the groves
of Academe<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.” Others resorted to Greece for purposes of travel or
health, and the hellebore of Antikyra (now Aspra Spitia) on the
Corinthian Gulf and the still popular baths of Ædepsos in Eubœa
were fashionable cures in good Roman society. Moreover, a tincture
of Greek letters was considered to be part of the education of a Roman
gentleman. Cicero constantly uses Greek phrases in his correspondence,
and Latin poets borrowed most of their plumes from Greek literature.</p>

<p>The two Roman civil wars which were fought on Greek soil between
49 and 31 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, were a great misfortune for Greece, whose inhabitants
took sides as if the cause were their own. The struggle between Cæsar
and Pompey was decided at Pharsalos in Thessaly, and most of the
Greeks found that they had chosen the cause of the vanquished, whose
exploits against the pirates and generous gift of money for the restoration
of Athens were still remembered. But Cæsar showed his usual
magnanimity towards the misguided Greeks, with the exception of
the Megareans, whose stubborn resistance to his arms was severely
punished. Most of the survivors of the siege were sold as slaves, and
one of Cæsar’s officials, writing to Cicero a little later, says that as
he sailed up the Saronic Gulf, the once flourishing cities of Megara,
the Piræus and Corinth lay in ruins before his eyes<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. It was Cæsar,
however, who in 44 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, raised the last of these towns from its ashes.
But the new Corinth, which he founded, was a Roman colony rather
than a Greek city, whose inhabitants were chiefly freedmen, and whose
name was at first associated with a lucrative traffic in antiquities,
derived from the plunder of the ancient tombs. Had he lived, Cæsar
had intended to dig a canal through the Isthmus—a feat reserved
for the reign of the late King George. On Cæsar’s death, his murderer,
Brutus, was enthusiastically welcomed by the Athenians, who erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
statues to him and Cassius besides those of the ancient tyrannicides,
Harmodios and Aristogeiton. The struggle between him and the
Triumvirs was decided at Philippi in Greek Macedonia, near the modern
Kavalla, but had little effect upon the fortunes of Greece, though there
were Greek contingents on either side. After the fall of Brutus, Antony
spent a long time at Athens, where he flattered the susceptible natives
by wearing their costume, amused them by his antics and orgies on
the Akropolis, gratified them by the gift of Ægina and other islands,
and scandalised them by the presence of Cleopatra, upon whom he
expected them to bestow the highest honours. When the war broke
out between him and Octavian for the mastery of the Roman world,
Greece for the second time became the theatre of her masters’ fratricidal
strife. At no previous time since the conquest had the unhappy country
suffered such oppression as then. The inhabitants were torn from their
homes to serve on the ships of Antony, the Peloponnese was divided
into two hostile camps according to the sympathies of the natives,
and in the great naval battle of Aktion the fleeing ship of Cleopatra
was pursued by a Lacedæmonian galley. The geographer Strabo, who
passed through Greece two years later, has left us a grim picture of
the state of the country. Bœotia was utterly ruined; Larissa was the
only town in Thessaly worth mentioning; many of the most famous
cities of the Peloponnese were barren wastes; Megalopolis was a
wilderness, Laconia had barely thirty towns; Dyme, whose citizens
had taken to piracy again, was falling into decay. The Ionian Islands
and Tegea formed pleasant exceptions to the general misery, but as an
instance of the wretched condition of the Ægean, the islet of Gyaros
was unable to pay its annual tribute of £5. The desolation of Greece
impressed Octavian so deeply that he founded two colonies for his
veterans on Hellenic soil, one in 30 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> on the spot where his camp
had been pitched at the battle of Aktion, which received the name of
Nikopolis (“City of victory”) in memory of that great triumph, the
other at Patras, a site most convenient for the Italian trade. In both
cases the numbers of the Roman colonists were augmented by the
compulsory immigration of the Greeks who inhabited the neighbouring
cities and villages. This measure had the bad effect of increasing the
depopulation of the surrounding country, but it imparted immediate
prosperity to both Patras and Nikopolis, and the factories of the
former gave employment to numbers of women, while the celebration
of the “Aktian games” at the latter colony attracted sight-seers from
other places. Augustus, as Octavian was now called, made an important
change in the administration of Greece, separating it from the Macedonian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
command, with which it had hitherto been combined, and
forming it in 27 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> into a separate senatorial province of Achaia,
which was practically identical with the boundaries of the Greek
kingdom before 1912, and of which Cæsar’s recently founded colony
of Corinth was made the capital. But this restriction of the limits of
the province did not affect the liberties of the different communities,
though here and there Augustus altered their respective jurisdictions.
Thus, in order to give Nikopolis a share in the Amphiktyonic Council,
he modified the composition of that ancient body, and he enfranchised
the Free Laconians who inhabited the central promontory of the
Peloponnese, from Sparta; thus founding the autonomy which that
rugged region has so often enjoyed<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. But Athens and Sparta both
continued to be “allies of Rome,” Augustus made a Spartan Prince
of the Lacedæmonians, and honoured them by his own presence at
their public meals. If he forbade the Athenians to sell the honour of
citizenship, he allowed himself to be initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries,
and his friend, Agrippa, presented Athens with a new theatre. As a
proof of their loyalty and gratitude, the Athenians dedicated a temple
on the Akropolis “to Augustus and Rome,” a large fragment of which
may still be seen, and erected a statue of Agrippa, the pedestal of
which is still standing in a perilous position at the approach to the
Propylæa. It was in further honour of the master of the Roman world,
that an aqueduct was constructed from the Klepsydra fountain to
the Tower of the Winds, which the Syrian Andronikos had built at
a somewhat earlier period of the Roman domination. The adjoining
gate of Athena Archegetis was raised out of money provided by Cæsar
and Augustus, a number of friendly princes proposed to complete the
temple of Olympian Zeus, while an inscription still preserves the
generosity of another ruler, Herod, King of the Jews, towards the home
of Greek culture.</p>

<p>The land now enjoyed a long period of peace, and began to recover
from the effects of the civil wars. A further boon was the transference
of Achaia from the jurisdiction of the Senate to that of the Emperor
soon after the accession of Tiberius, who, whatever his private vices
may have been, was most considerate in his treatment of the provincials.
He sternly repressed attempts at extortion, kept his governors in office
for long terms, and, when an earthquake injured the city of Aigion
on the gulf of Corinth, excused the citizens from the payment of taxes
for three years. The restriction of the much-abused right of asylum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
in various temples, such as that of Poseidon on the island of Tenos,
and the delimitation of the Messenian and Lacedæmonian boundary,
showed the interest of the Roman Government in Greek affairs; and
the cult of the Imperial family, which was now developed in Greece,
was perhaps due to gratitude no less than to the natural obsequience
of a conquered race. The visit of the Emperor’s nephew, Germanicus,
to Athens delighted the Athenians and scandalised Roman officialdom
by the Imperial traveller’s disregard of etiquette; and it was insinuated
by a prejudiced Roman even at that early period that these voluble
burgesses, who talked so much about their past history, were not
really the descendants of the ancient Greeks, but “the offscourings of
the nations.” So deep was the impression made by the courtesy of
Germanicus that, several years later, an impostor, who pretended to
be his son Drusus, found a ready following in Greece, which he traversed
from the Cyclades to Nikopolis. It became the custom, too, to banish
distinguished Romans, who had incurred the Emperor’s displeasure,
to an Ægean island, and Amorgos, Kythnos, Seriphos, and Gyaros
were the equivalent of Botany Bay. The last two islets in particular
were regarded with intense horror, and Juvenal has selected them as
types of the worst punishment that could befall one of his countrymen<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.
Caligula, less moderate than Tiberius in his treatment of the Greeks,
carried off the famous statue of Eros from Thespiæ, for which his
unaccomplished plan of cutting the Isthmus of Corinth was no compensation.
Claudius restored the stolen statue, and in 44 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> handed over
the province of Achaia to the Senate—an arrangement which, with
one brief interval, continued to be the practice of the Roman Government
for the future. Meanwhile, alike under Senatorial and Imperial
administration, the Greeks had acquired Roman tastes and had even
adopted in many cases Roman names. If old-fashioned Romans
complained that Rome had become “a Greek city,” where glib Hellenic
freedmen had the ear of the Emperor and starving Greeklings were
ready to practise any and every profession, the conservatives in Greece
lamented the introduction of such peculiarly Roman sports as the
gladiatorial shows, of which the remains of the Roman amphitheatre
at Corinth are a memorial. The conquering and the conquered races
had reacted on one another; the Romans had become more literary;
the Greeks had become more material.</p>

<p>It was at this period, about 54 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, that an event occurred which
profoundly modified the future of the Greek race. In, or a little before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
that year St Paul arrived at Athens, and, stirred by the idolatry of
the city, delivered his famous speech in the midst of the Areopagos.
The unvarnished narrative of the Acts of the Apostles does not disguise
the failure of the great teacher’s first attempt to convert the argumentative
Greeks, to whom the new gospel seemed “foolishness.” But
“Dionysios the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others
with them,” believed, thus forming the small beginnings of the Church
which grew up there in later days. From Athens the Apostle proceeded
to Corinth, where he stayed “a year and six months.” The capital
of Achaia and mart of Greece was a fine field for his missionary labours.
The Roman colony, which had now been in existence almost a century,
had become the home of commerce and the luxury which usually
accompanies it. The superb situation, commanding the two seas, had
attracted a cosmopolitan population, including many Jews, and the
vices of the East and the West seemed to meet on the Isthmus—the
Port Said of the Roman Empire. We may trace in the language of the
two Epistles, which the Apostle addressed to the Corinthians later on,
the main characteristics of the seat of Roman rule in Greece. The
allusions to the fights with wild beasts, to the Isthmian games, to the
long hair of the Corinthian dandies, to the easy virtue of the Corinthian
women, all show what was the daily life of the most flourishing city
of Greece in the middle of the first century. Yet even at Corinth many
were persuaded by the arguments of the tent-maker, and a Christian
community was founded at the port of Kenchreæ on the Saronic
Gulf. At the outset the converts were of humble origin, like “the
house of Stephanas, the first fruits of Achaia”; but Gaius, Tertius,
Quartus, and “Erastus, the chamberlain of the city,” were persons
of better position. That a man like Gallio, the brother of Seneca the
philosopher and uncle of Lucan the poet, a man whom the other great
poet of the day, Statius, has described as “sweetness” itself, was at
that time governor of Achaia, shows the importance attached by the
Romans to their Greek province. St Paul had not the profound classical
learning of the governor’s talented family, but the two Epistles to
the Thessalonians, which he wrote during this first stay at Corinth,
have conferred an undying literary interest on the capital of Roman
Greece. Silas and Timotheus joined the Apostle at that place; and
after his departure the learned Alexandrian, Apollos, carried on the
work of Christianity among the Corinthians. But the germs of those
theological parties, which were destined later on to divide the Greek
Christians, had already been planted in the congenial soil of Achaia.
The Christian community of Corinth, with the fatal tendency to faction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
which has ever marked the Hellenic race, was soon split up into sections,
which followed, one St Paul, another Apollos, another the supposed
injunctions of St Peter, another the simple faith of Christ. Even women,
and that, too, unveiled, like the Laises of Corinth, had taken upon
themselves to speak at Christian gatherings, and drinking and the
other sensual crimes of that luxurious city had proved temptations
too strong for some of the new converts. This state of things provoked
the two Epistles to the Corinthians and the second visit of the
Apostle to the then Greek capital, where he remained three months,
writing on this occasion also two Epistles from Greece—that to the
Romans and that to the Galatians. For the sake of the greater security
which the land route afforded, he returned to Asia through Northern
Greece, accompanied among others by St Luke, whose traditional
connection with Greece may be traced in the wax figure of the
Virgin, said to be his work, in the monastery of Megaspelæon,
and in the much later Roman tomb venerated as his, at Thebes.
With the exception of his delay at Fair Havens on the south coast
of Crete, we are not told by the writer of the Acts that St Paul
ever set foot on Greek territory again; but he left Titus in that
island “to ordain elders in every city,” and contemplated spending
a winter at Nikopolis. A tradition, unsupported, however, by good
evidence, has been preserved to the effect that he was liberated from
his Roman imprisonment, and it has been supposed that he employed
part of the time that remained before his death in revisiting Corinth
and Crete. His “kinsmen,” Jason and Sosipater, bishops of Tarsus
and Ikonium, preached the Word at Corfù, where one of them was
martyred, and where one of the two oldest churches of the island
still preserves their names<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. The Greek journey of the pagan philosopher,
Apollonios of Tyana, who tried to restore the ancient life of Hellas and
to check the Romanising tendencies of the age, took place only a few
years after the first appearance of the Apostle of the Gentiles in Greece.</p>

<p>Another visitor of a very different kind next arrived in the classic
land. Nero had already displayed his taste for the fine arts by despatching
an emissary to Greece with the object of collecting statues for the
adornment of his palace and capital. Delphi, Olympia and Athens,
where, in the phrase of a contemporary satirist, “it was easier to meet
a god than a man,” furnished an ample booty, and the Thespians again
lost, this time for ever, the statue of Eros. But Nero was not content
with the sculpture of Greece; he yearned to display his manifold
talents before a Greek audience, “the only one,” as he said, “worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
of himself and his accomplishments.” Accordingly, in 66, he crossed
over to Kassopo in Corfù, and began his theatrical tour by singing
before the altar of Zeus there. Such was the zeal of the Imperial pot-hunter,
that he commanded all the national games to be celebrated
in the same year, so that he might have the satisfaction of winning
prizes at them all in the same tour. In order to exhibit his musical
gifts, he ordered the insertion of a new item in the time-honoured
programme at Olympia, where he built himself a house, and at Corinth
broke the Isthmian rules by contending in both tragedy and comedy.
As a charioteer he eclipsed all previous performances by driving ten
horses abreast, upsetting his car and still receiving the prize from the
venal judges; as a victor, he had the effrontery to proclaim his own
victory, and the number of his wreaths might have done credit to a
royal funeral. In return for their compliance, the Greeks were informed
by the voice of the Emperor himself on the day of the Isthmian games
that they were once more free from the jurisdiction of the Senate and
exempt from the payment of taxes<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The name of freedom and the
practical advantage of fiscal immunity appealed with force to the
patriotic and commercial sides of the Greek character, and outweighed
the extortions of the Emperor and his suite to such a degree that
Nero became a popular hero, in whose honour medals were struck
and statues erected. To signalise yet further his stay in Greece, he
bade the long projected canal to be dug across the Isthmus. This
time the work was actually begun, and a prominent philosopher, who
had incurred the Imperial displeasure, was seen digging away with
a gang of other convicts. Nero himself dug the first sod with a golden
spade, and carried away the first spadefuls of earth in a basket on his
shoulders. But the task, of which traces may still be seen, was soon
abandoned, and the dangers which threatened his throne recalled
the Emperor to Italy. But first he consulted the Oracle of Delphi,
which fully maintained its ancient reputation for obscurity and
accuracy, but was bidden henceforth to be dumb. The two most
celebrated seats of Greek antiquity, Athens and Sparta, he left, however,
unvisited—Sparta, because he disapproved of its institutions; Athens,
because he, the matricide, feared the vengeance of the Furies, whose
fabled shrine was beneath the Areopagos<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>The civil war, which raged in Italy between the death of Nero and
the accession of Vespasian, had little influence upon Greece, except that
it gave an adventurer, who bore a striking resemblance to the late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Emperor and shared his musical tastes, the opportunity of personating
him. But this pretender, who had made himself master of the island
of Kythnos, was soon suppressed<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, and Vespasian, as he visited Greece
on his way from the East to Rome, could calmly study the condition
of that country. The stern old soldier, who, in spite of his Greek culture,
had fallen asleep during Nero’s recitations, had no sympathy with
Greek antiquities, and maintained that the Hellenes did not know how
to use their newly-restored freedom, which had involved the impoverished
Roman exchequer in the loss of the Greek taxes. He
accordingly restored the organisation and fiscal arrangements which
had been in force before Nero’s proclamation, only that the province
of Achaia under the Flavian dynasty no longer included Thessaly,
Epeiros, and Akarnania. For a long time Greece had no political history;
but we know that Domitian, like Tiberius, was as considerate towards
the provincials as he was tyrannical to the Roman nobles; that he
cherished a special cult for the goddess Athena; and that he deigned
to allow himself to be nominated as Archon Eponymos of Athens for
the year 93—an instance which shows the continuance of an institution
which had been founded nearly eight centuries earlier. Trajan’s direct
connection with Greece was limited to a stay at Athens on the way
to the Parthian war, but he counted among his friends the most
celebrated Greek author of that age, the famous Plutarch, who passed
a great part of his time in the small Bœotian town of Chaironeia, where
his so-called “chair,” obviously the end seat of one of the rows in the
theatre, may still be seen in the little church. Like Polybios in the
first period of the Roman conquest, Plutarch served as a link to unite
the Greeks and their masters. At once an Hellenic patriot and an
admirer of Rome, he combined love of the past independence of his
country with a shrewd sense of the advantages of Roman rule in the
existing circumstances. True, the Greece of his time was very different
from that of the Golden Age. While the single city of Megara had sent
3000 heavy armed men to the battle of Platæa, the whole province
of Achaia could not raise a larger number in his days. Depopulation
was going on apace; Eubœa was almost desolate, and the inland towns
of the mainland were mostly losing their trade, which was gravitating
to the coasts. The expenditure of the Greek taxes at Rome led to the
want of funds for public objects, and the Roman system of making
immunity from taxation a principle of Roman citizenship divided the
Greeks into two classes, the rich and the poor. The former led luxurious
lives, built expensive houses, added acre to acre, and fell into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
hands of the foreign money-lenders of Corinth or Patras. The latter
sank lower and lower in the social scale, and it was noticed that, while
the Greek women had become more beautiful, the classic grace of
Hellenic manhood had declined. But Greece continued to exercise
her perennial charm on the cultured traveller. In spite of the Thessalian
brigands, tourists journeyed to see the Vale of Tempe, and a race of
loquacious guides arose, whose business it was to explain the history
of Delphi. Men of the highest rank were proud to be made Athenian
citizens, and one of them, Antiochos Philopappos, grandson of the last
king of Kommagene, was commemorated in the last years of Trajan
by the monument which is to-day one of the most conspicuous in all
Athens.</p>

<p>The reign of Hadrian was a very happy period for the Greeks.
A lover of both ancient and contemporary Hellas, which he visited
several times, the Imperial traveller left his mark all over the country.
We may gather from Pausanias, whose own wanderings began at this
period, that there was scarcely a single Greek city of importance which
had not received some benefit from this Emperor. Coins of Patras
describe him as “the restorer of Achaia,” Megara regarded him as her
“second founder,” Mantineia had to thank him for the restoration of
her classical name. Alive to the want of through communication
between the Peloponnese and Central Greece, he built a safe road
along the Skironian cliffs, where now the tourist looks down on the
azure sea from the train that takes him from Megara to Corinth. He
provided the latter city with water by means of an aqueduct from
Lake Stymphalos, and began the aqueduct at Athens which was
completed by his successor. But this was only one of his many Athenian
improvements. His affection for Athens, where he lived as a Greek
among Greeks and had held the office of Archon Eponymos, like
Domitian, led him to assign the revenues of Cephalonia to the Athenian
treasury, to regulate the oil-trade, that important branch of Attic
commerce, his edict about which may still be read on the gate of Athena
Archegetis, to repair the theatre of Dionysos, and to present the city
with a Pantheon, a library, contained within the Stoa which still bears
his name and of which part is still standing, and a gymnasium. He
also built there a temple of Hera, and completed that of Zeus Olympios,
which had been begun by Peisistratos more than six centuries before
and had provided Sulla with spoil. The still standing columns of this
magnificent building formed the nucleus of the “new Athens,” which
he founded outside “the old city of Theseus,” and to which the Arch
of Hadrian, as the inscriptions upon it show, was intended as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
entrance. With another of his foundations, the temple of Zeus Panhellenios,
was connected the institution of the Panhellenic festival,
which represented the unity of the Greek race and, like the more ancient
games, had a religious basis. Hadrian called into existence a synod
of “Panhellenes,” composed of members of the Greek communities
on both sides of the Ægean, who met at Athens and whose treasurer
was styled “Hellenotamias,” or “steward of the Hellenes”—a title
borrowed from the classical Confederacy of Delos. In name, indeed,
the golden age of Athens seemed to have returned, and the enthusiastic
Athenians heaped one honour after another upon the head of the great
Philhellene. They adored him as a god, and the President of the
Panhellenic synod became his priest; his statues rose all over the city,
his name was bestowed upon one of the months, a thirteenth tribe
was formed and called after him, and the thirteen wedges of the
repaired theatre of Dionysos contained each a bust of Hadrian; even
an unworthy favourite of the Emperor was dubbed a deity with the
same ease that we convert a charitable tradesman into a peer.</p>

<p>Hadrian’s two immediate successors continued his Philhellenic
policy. Antoninus Pius erected new buildings for the use of the visitors
to that fashionable health-resort, the Hieron of Epidauros; and in
graceful recognition of the legend, according to which the founders
of the first settlement on the Palatine were emigrants from Pallantion
in Arkadia, raised that village to the rank of a city, with the privileges
of self-government and immunity from taxes. Marcus Aurelius seemed
to have realised the Utopian ideal of Plato, that philosophers should
be kings or kings philosophers. The Imperial author of the <i>Meditations</i>
wrote in Greek, had sat at the feet of Greek teachers, and greatly
admired the products of the Greek intellect. But his reign was disturbed
by warlike alarms, and it is noteworthy that at this period the first
of those barbarian tribes from the North, which inflicted so much
injury upon Greece in later centuries, penetrated into that country.
The Greeks showed, however, that they had not in the long years of
peace, forgotten how to defend themselves. At Elateia the Kostobokes—such
was the name of the marauders—received a check from a local
force and withdrew beyond the frontier<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. In spite of his distant campaigns,
Marcus Aurelius found time to visit Athens, restored the temple
at Eleusis, was initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, and founded
in 176 the Athenian University. It was, indeed, the heyday of Academic
life, and Athens was under the Antonines the happy hunting-ground
of professors, who received salaries from the Imperial exchequer, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
enjoyed the privilege of exemption from costly public duties. One
of their number, Herodes Atticus of Marathon, has, by his splendid
gifts to the city, perpetuated his fame to our own time. His vast
wealth, united to his renown as a professor of rhetoric, not only made
him the most prominent man in Athens, where he held the post of
President of the new Panhellenic synod, but gained him the Roman
consulship, the friendship of Hadrian, and the honour of instructing
the early years of Marcus Aurelius. When Verus, the colleague of the
latter in the Imperial dignity, visited Athens, it was as the guest of
the sophist of Marathon; when the University was founded, it was
Herodes who selected the professors. The charm of his villas at Kephisia,
then, as now, the suburban pleasaunce of the dust-choked Athenians,
and in his native village, has been extolled by one of his pupils, while
the Odeion which still bears his name was erected by him to the memory
of his second wife<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. He also restored the Stadion, which had been built
by Lykourgos about five centuries earlier, and within its precincts
his body was interred. There still exist remains of his temple of Fortune,
a goddess of whom he had varied experiences. For his vast wealth and
the sense of their own inferiority caused the Athenians to revile their
benefactor, and as many of them owed him money, he was naturally
regarded as their enemy until his death. Many other Greek cities
benefited by his liberality; he built a theatre at Corinth and restored
the bathing establishment at Thermopylæ; and he was even accused
of making life too easy for his fellow-countrymen because he provided
Olympia with pure water by means of an aqueduct, of which the
Exedra is still visible.</p>

<p>It was at this period, too, that the traveller Pausanias wrote his
famous <i>Description of Greece</i>, a work which gives a faithful account
of that country as it struck his observant eyes. Compared with what
it had been in Strabo’s time, the land seemed prosperous in the age
of the Antonines, though some districts had never recovered from the
ravages of the Roman wars. Much of Bœotia was still in the desolate
state in which Sulla had left it; Ætolia had not been inhabited since
Octavian carried off its population to Nikopolis; the lower town of
Thebes was quite deserted, and the ancient name was then, as now,
confined to the ancient Akropolis, while the sole occupants of Delos
were the Athenians sent to guard the temple. But Delphi was in a
flourishing condition, the Roman colonies of Patras and Corinth
continued to prosper, and among the ancient cities of the Peloponnese,
Argos and Sparta still held the foremost rank, while the much more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
modern Megalopolis, upon which such high hopes had been built,
shared the fate of Tiryns and Mycenæ. Moreover, despite the robbery
of statues by Romans from Mummius to Nero, Pausanias found a vast
number of ancient masterpieces all over the country, and even the
paintings, with which Polygnotos had adorned the Stoa Poikile at
Athens, were still visible. As for the relics of classical lore and prehistoric
legend, they abounded in every city that could boast of a
hero, and the remark of Cicero was as true in the time of Pausanias,
that in a Greek town one came upon the traces of history at every
step. In the second century, too, good Doric was still spoken by the
Messenians; and, if the pure Attic of Plato had been somewhat corrupted
at Athens by the presence of many foreign students, it was
still preserved in all its glory by the peasants of Attica. The writings
of Lucian at this period show how even a Syrian could, by long residence
at Athens, acquire a masterly gift of Attic prose. The illusion of a
classical revival was further kept up by the continuance of ancient
institutions, even though they had lost the reality of power. Pausanias
mentions the existence, and describes the composition, of the Amphiktyonic
Council in his time, when it was still the guardian of the Delphic
oracle. The Court of the Areopagos preserved its ancient forms at Athens;
the Ephors and other Spartan authorities had survived the disapproval
of Nero; the Confederacy of the Free Laconians, though reduced in
size, still included eighteen cities; Bœotia and Phokis enjoyed the
privilege of local assemblies. The great games still attracted competitors
and spectators; the great oracles still found some believers, who
consulted them; and the old religion, if it had little moral force, was,
at least in externals, still that of the majority, though philosophers
regretted it and enlightened persons like Pausanias inclined to a rational
interpretation of the myths, and told stories of bribes administered
to the Pythian priestess. Christianity had made little progress in
Greece during the three generations that had elapsed since the last
visit of St Paul. Mention is, indeed, made by the Christian historian,
Eusebius, of large communities at Larissa, Sparta, and in Crete; but
Corinth still remained the chief seat of the new faith, and the Corinthian
Christians still retained that factious spirit which St Paul had rebuked.
Athens, as the home of philosophy, was little favourable to the simplicity
of the Gospel; but the celebrated Athenian philosopher, Aristides,
was not only converted to Christianity, but presented an Apology for
that creed to Hadrian during his residence in the city; while another
Athenian, Hyginos, was chosen Pope in the age of the Antonines.
Anacletos, the second (or, in other lists, fourth) Bishop of Rome after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
St Peter, is said to have been a native of Athens, and a third, Xystos,
perished, as Pope Sixtus II, in the persecution of Valerian. The tradition
that Dionysios the Areopagite, became first Bishop of Athens<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, and
there gained the crown of martyrdom, and that St Andrew suffered
death at Patras, has been cherished, and in the case of Patras has had
a considerable historical influence.</p>

<p>With the death of Marcus Aurelius the series of Philhellenic
Emperors ended, and the Roman civil wars in the last decade of the
second century occupied the attention of the Empire. Without taking
an active part in the struggle, Greece submitted to the authority of
Pescennius Niger, one of the unsuccessful candidates, and this temporary
error of judgment may have induced the Emperor Septimius Severus
to inflict a punishment upon Athens, the cause of which is usually
ascribed to a slight which he suffered during his student days there.
His successor, Caracalla, by extending the Roman citizenship to all
free inhabitants of the Empire, gave the Greeks an opportunity, of
which they were not slow to avail themselves. From that moment the
doors of the Roman administration were thrown open to all the races
of the Roman dominions, and the nimble-witted Greeks so obtained
a predominance in that department such as they acquired much later
under Turkish rule. From that moment, too, they considered themselves
as “Romans,” and the name stuck to them long after the Roman
Empire had passed away. But Caracalla, while he thus made them
the equals of the Romans in the eyes of the law, increased the taxes
which it had long been the privilege of Roman citizens to pay, while
he continued to exact those which the provincials had paid previous
to their admission to the citizenship. The reductions made by his
successors, Macrinus and Alexander Severus, were to a large extent
neutralised by the great depreciation of the currency, which began
under Caracalla and continued for the next half century. The Government
paid its creditors in depreciated money, but took good care that
the taxes were paid in good gold pieces. The worst results followed:
officials were tempted, like the modern Turkish Pashas, to recoup
themselves by extortion for the diminution in their salaries; trade
with foreign countries became uncertain, even the specially thriving
Greek industries of marble and purple dye must have been affected,
and possessors of good coin buried it in the ground. Amid this dismal
scene of decay, Athens continued to preserve her reputation as a
University town. Though no longer patronised by cultured Emperors,
she still attracted numbers of pupils to her lecture rooms; and the name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
of Longinus, author of the celebrated treatise, <i>On the Sublime</i>, adorns
the scanty Athenian annals of this period. That the drama was not
neglected is clear from the inscription which records the restoration
of the theatre of Dionysos by the Archon Phaidros during this period.
But the philosophers and playgoers of Athens were soon to be roused
by the alarm of an invasion such as their city had not experienced for
many a generation.</p>

<p>Hitherto, with the unimportant exception of the raid of the Kostobokes
as far as Elateia, Greece had never been submitted to the terrors
of a barbarian inroad since the Roman Conquest, The Roman Empire
had protected Achaia from foreign attack, and even the least friendly
of the Emperors had allowed no one to plunder the art treasures of
the Greek cities except their own occasional emissaries. Hence the
Greece of the middle of the third century preserved in many respects
the same external appearance as that of the same country four hundred
years earlier. But this blessing of peace, which Rome had conferred
upon the Greeks, had had the bad effect of training up a nation which
was a stranger to the arts of war. Caracalla, indeed, had raised a couple
of Spartan regiments; but the local militia of the Greek cities had had
no experience of fighting, and the fortifications of the country had been
allowed to fall into ruin. Such was the state of the Greek defences
when in 250 the Goths crossed the Balkans and entered what is now
South Bulgaria. Measures were at once taken to defend the Greek
provinces. Claudius, afterwards Emperor, was ordered to occupy the
historic pass of Thermopylæ, but his forces were small and most of
them had been newly enrolled. The death of the Emperor Decius,
fighting against the Goths, increased the alarm, and the siege of Salonika
thoroughly startled the Greeks. No sooner had Valerian mounted the
Imperial throne, than they signalised his reign by repairing the walls
of Athens, which had been neglected since the siege of Sulla<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, and it
was perhaps at the same time that a fort and a new gate were erected
for the defence of the Akropolis<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. As a second line of defence the
fortifications across the Isthmus were restored, and occupied, just as
by Peloponnesian troops of old on the approach of the Persian host.
But these preparations did not long preserve the country from the
attacks of the Goths. Distracted by the rival claims of self-styled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Emperors, Valens in Achaia, and Piso in Thessaly, who had availed
themselves of the general confusion to declare their independence,
and visited by a terrible plague which followed in the wake of the Roman
armies, the Greeks soon had the Gothic hosts upon them. A first raid
was repulsed, only to be repeated in 267 on a far larger scale. This time
the Goths and fierce Heruli arrived by sea, and, after ravaging the
storied island of Skyros, captured Argos, Sparta, and the lower city
of Corinth. Athens herself was surprised by the enemy, before the
Emperor Gallienus, whose admiration for the ancient city had been
shown by his initiation into the Eleusinian mysteries and his acceptance
of the Athenian citizenship with the office of Archon Eponymos, could
send troops to her assistance. But at this crisis in her history, Athens
showed herself worthy of her glorious past. At that time one of her
leading citizens was the historian Dexippos, whose writings on the
Scythian wars, preserved now only in fragments, were favourably
compared by a Byzantine critic with those of Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. But
Dexippos, if a less caustic writer, was a better general, than the historian
of the Peloponnesian war. He assembled a body of Athenians, addressed
them in a fiery harangue, a fragment of which still exists<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>,
and reminded them that the event of battles was usually decided
by bravery rather than by numbers. Marshalling his troops in the
Olive Grove, he accustomed them little by little to the noise of the
Gothic war cries and the sight of the Gothic warriors. The arrival of
a Roman fleet effected a timely diversion, and the barbarians, taken
between two hostile forces, abandoned Athens and succumbed to the
Emperor’s arms on their march towards the North. Fortunately they
seem to have spared the monuments of the city during their occupation,
and we are told that the Athenian libraries were saved from the flames
by the deep policy of a shrewd Goth, who thought that the pursuit of
literature would unfit the Greeks for the art of war<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. Dexippos, who
proved by his own example the compatibility of learning with strategy,
has been commemorated in an inscription, which praises his merits as
a writer, but is silent about his fame as a maker, of history—known
to us from a single sentence of the Latin biographer of Gallienus<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Yet
at that moment Greece needed men of action rather than men of
letters. For another Gothic invasion took place two years later, and
from Thessaly to Crete the vessels of the barbarians harried the coasts.
But the interval had been used to put the defences of the cities into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
repair; and such was the ill-success of the invaders, who could not
take a single town, that they did not renew the attack. For more
than a century the land was spared the horrors of a fresh Gothic war.
The great victory of the Emperor Claudius II over the Goths at Nish
and the abandonment of what is now Roumania to them by his successor
Aurelian secured the peace of Achaia. Although the three
invasions had resulted in the loss of a considerable amount of moveable
property and of many slaves, who had either been carried off as captives
or had escaped from their Greek masters to the Gothic ranks, the
recovery of Athens and Corinth seems to have been so rapid that seven
years after the last raid they were among the nine cities of the Empire
to which the Roman Senate wrote announcing the election of the
Emperor Tacitus and bidding them direct any appeals from the Proconsul
to the Prefect of the City of Rome—a clear proof of their civic
importance.</p>

<p>But the Greeks soon looked for the fountain of justice elsewhere
than on the banks of the Tiber. With the reign of Diocletian began
the practice of removing the seat of Government from Rome, and that
Emperor usually resided at Nicomedia. His establishment of four
great administrative divisions of the Empire really separated the two
Eastern, in which Greece was comprehended, from the two Western,
and prepared the way for the foundation of Constantinople by Constantine
and the ultimate division of the Eastern and Western Empires.
Diocletian’s further increase in the number of the provinces, several
of which were grouped under one of the Dioceses, into which the Empire
was split up for administrative purposes, had the double effect of
altering the size of the Greek provinces, and of scattering them over
several Dioceses. Thus Achaia, Thessaly, “Old” Epeiros (as the region
round Nikopolis was now called), and Crete, formed four separate
provinces included in the Mœsian Diocese, the administrative centre
of which was Sirmium, the modern Mitrovitz. The Ægean islands, on
the other hand, composed one of the provinces of the Asian Diocese.
The province of Achaia had, however, the privilege of being administered
by a Proconsul, who was an official of more exalted rank than the great
majority of provincial governors. Side by side with these arrangements,
the currency reform of Diocletian and the edict by which he fixed the
highest price of commodities cannot fail to have affected the trade
of Greece, while his love of building benefited the Greek marble quarries.</p>

<p>After the abdication of Diocletian the Christians of Greece were
visited by another of those persecutions, of which they had had
experience under the Emperor Decius half a century earlier. But on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
neither occasion were the martyrdoms numerous, except in Crete, and
it would appear that Christianity in Greece was less prosperous, or less
progressive, than the same creed in the great cities of the East, where
the victims were far more numerous. Constantine’s toleration made
him as popular with the Greek Christians as his marked respect for
the Athenian University made him with the Greek philosophers, and
it is, therefore, no wonder that in his final struggle against his rival,
Licinius, he was able to collect a Greek fleet, which mustered in the
harbour of the Piræus, then once more an important station, and
forced for him the passage of the Dardanelles. But the reign of
Constantine, although he found a biographer in the young Athenian
historian, Praxagoras<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, was not conducive to the national development
of Greece. Adopting the administrative system of Diocletian, he
continued the practice of dividing the Empire into four great “Prefectures,”
as they were now called, each of which was subdivided into
Dioceses, and the latter again into provinces. The four Greek provinces
of Thessaly, Achaia (including some of the Cyclades and some of the
Ionian Islands), Old Epeiros (including Corfù and Ithake), and Crete
(of which Gortyna was the capital), formed part of the Diocese of
Macedonia in the Prefecture of Illyricum, whereas the rest of the
Greek islands composed a distinct province of the Asian Diocese in
the Prefecture of the Orient. Thus, the Greek race continued to be
split into fragments, while at the same time the levelling tendency
of Constantine’s administration gradually swept away those Greek
municipal institutions, which had hitherto survived all changes, and
thus the inhabitants of different parts of the country began to lose
their peculiar characteristics. A few time-honoured vestiges of ancient
Greek freedom existed for some time longer; thus the Areopagos
and the Archons of Athens and the provincial assembly of Achaia
may be traced on into the fifth century. But their place was taken
by the new local senates, composed of so-called <i>Decuriones</i>, who
were chosen from the richest landowners, and who had to collect,
and were held personally responsible for, the amount of the land-tax.
This onerous office was made hereditary, and there was no means of
escaping it except by death or flight to a monastic cell; even a journey
outside the country required a special permit from the governor, and
the rich <i>Decurio</i>, like the mediæval serf, was tied down to the land
which he was so unfortunate as to own. Even an Irish landlord’s lot
seems happy compared with that of a Greek <i>Decurio</i>, nor was the
provincial who escaped the unpleasant privilege of serving the State<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
in that capacity greatly to be envied. The exaction of taxes became
at once more stringent and more regular—a combination peculiarly
objectionable to the Oriental mind—and the re-assessment of their
burdens every fifteen years led the people to calculate time by the
“Indictions,” or edicts in which, with all the solemnity of purple
ink, the Emperor fixed the amount of the imposts for this new cycle
of taxation. That the ruler himself became conscious of the inequalities
of his subjects’ contributions was evident half a century later when
Valentinian I allowed the citizens of each municipality to elect an
official, styled <i>Defensor</i>, whose duty it was to defend his fellow-citizens
before the Emperor against the fiscal exactions of the authorities.</p>

<p>The transference of the capital to Constantinople, enormous as its
ultimate results have proved to be, was at first a disadvantage to the
inhabitants of Greece. We are accustomed to look on the centre of
the Byzantine Empire as a largely Greek city, but it must be remembered
that, at the outset, it was Roman in conception and that its language
was Latin. Almost immediately, however, it began to drain Greece
of its population, attracted by the prospects of work and the certainty
of “bread and games” in the New Rome. In the days of Demosthenes
Byzantium had been the granary of Athens; now Attica, always
unproductive of wheat, began to find that Constantine’s growing
capital had to import bread-stuffs for its own use, and the Athenians
were thankful for an annual grant of corn from the Emperor. The
founder wanted, too, Greek works of art to adorn his city, and 427
statues were placed in Sta Sophia alone; the Muses of Helikon were
carried off to the palace of the Emperor; the serpent column, which
the grateful Greeks had dedicated at Delphi after the battle of Platæa,
was set up in the Hippodrome, where one of its three heads was struck
off by the battle-axe of Mohammed II.</p>

<p>The conversion of Constantine to Christianity had the natural
effect of bringing within the Christian ranks those lukewarm pagans
who took their religious views from the Emperor. But the comparative
immunity from persecution which the Christians of Greece
had enjoyed under the pagan ascendancy led them to treat their
opponents with the same mildness. There was no reaction, because
there had been no revolution, and the devotees of the old and the
new religion went on living peaceably side by side. The even greater
temptation to the subtle Greek intellect to indulge in the wearisome
Arian controversy, which so long convulsed a large part of the Church
in the East, was rejected owing to the fortunate unanimity of the
bishops who were sent from Greece to attend the Council of Nice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Their strong and united opposition to the heresy of Arius was re-echoed
by their flocks at home, and the Church, undivided on this crucial
question, became more and more identified with the people. After
Constantine’s death the harmony between the pagans and the Christians
was temporarily disturbed. Under Constantius II the public offerings
ceased, the temples were closed, the oracles fell into disuse; under
Julian the Apostate a final attempt was made to rehabilitate the
ancient religion. Julian seemed, indeed, to the conservative party in
Greece to have restored for two brief years the silver age of Hadrian,
if not the golden age of Perikles. The jealousy of Constantius, by
sending him in honourable exile to Athens, had made him an enthusiastic
admirer of not only the literature but the creed of the old Hellenes.
It was at that time that he abjured Christianity and was initiated into
the Eleusinian mysteries, and when he took up arms against Constantius
it was to the Corinthians, Lacedæmonians, and Athenians that he
addressed Apologies for his conduct. These manifestoes, of which that
to the Athenians is still extant among the writings of Julian, had such
an effect upon the Greeks, flattered no doubt by such an attention,
that they declared in his favour, and on his rival’s death they had
their reward. The temples were re-opened, the altars once more smoked
with the offerings of the devout, the great games were revived, including
the Aktian festival of Augustus, which had fallen into decline with
the falling fortunes of Nikopolis. Julian restored that city and others
like it, and the Argives did not appeal in vain for a rehearing of a
wearisome law-suit with Corinth to an Emperor who was steeped to
the lips in classic lore. At Athens he purged the University by excluding
Christians from professorial chairs, Christian students were often converted,
like the Emperor, by the genius of the place, and the University
became the last refuge of Hellenism in Greece, when Julian’s attempted
restoration of the old order of things collapsed at his death. Throughout
this period, indeed, the University of Athens was not only the chief
intellectual centre of the Empire—for Rome had ceased, and the newly
founded University of Constantinople had not yet begun, to attract
the best intellects—but it was the all-absorbing institution of the city.
Athenian trade had gone on decaying, and under Constans, the son
of Constantine, the people of Athens were obliged to ask the Emperor
for the grant of certain insular revenues, which he allowed them to
devote to the purchase of provisions. So Athens was now solely a
University town, and the ineradicable yearning of the Greeks for
politics found vent, in default of a larger opening, in such academic
struggles as the election of a professor or the merits of the rival corps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of students. These corps, each composed as a rule of students from the
same district, kept Athens alive with their disputes, which sometimes
degenerated into pitched battles calling for the intervention of the
Roman governor from Corinth. So keen was the competition between
them, that their agents were posted at the Piræus to accost the sea-sick
freshman as soon as he landed and enlist him in this or that corps.
Each corps had its favourite professor, for whose class it obtained pupils,
by force or argument, and whose lectures it applauded whenever the
master brought out some fresh conceit or distorted the flexible Greek
language into some new combination of words. The celebrated sophist
Libanios, and the poetic divine, Gregory of Nazianzos, respectively the
apologist and the censor of Julian, have left us a graphic sketch of
the student life in their time at Athens, when the scarlet and gold
garments of the lecturers and the gowns of their pupils mingled in the
streets of the ancient city, which still deserved in this fourth century
the proud title of “the eye of Greece.”</p>

<p>The triumph of paganism ceased with the death of Julian; but his
successor Jovian, though he ordered the Church of the Virgin to be
erected at Corfù out of the fragments of a heathen temple opposite
the royal villa<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, proclaimed universal toleration. His wise example
was followed by Valentinian I, who repealed Julian’s edict which had
made the profession of paganism a test of professorial office at Athens,
and allowed his subjects to approach heaven in what manner they
pleased. The Greeks were specially exempted from the law forbidding
nocturnal sacrifices because it would “make their life unendurable.”
The Eleusinian mysteries were permitted to be celebrated, and Athens
continued to derive much profit from those festivals. It was fortunate
for the Greeks that, at the partition of the Empire between him and
Valens in 364, the Prefecture of Illyricum, which included the bulk
of the Greek provinces, was joined to the Western half, and thus fell
to his share. His reign marked the last stage of that peaceful development
which had gone on in Greece since the Gothic invasion of the
previous century. A few years after his death the Emperor Theodosius I
publicly proclaimed the Catholic faith to be the established creed of
the Empire, and proceeded to stamp out paganism with all the zeal
of a Spaniard. The Oracle of Delphi was closed for ever, the temples
were shut, and in 393 the Olympic games, which had been the rallying

token of their discontinuance the statue of Zeus, which had stood in
the temple of the god at Olympia, was removed to Constantinople,
and the time-honoured custom of reckoning time by the Olympiads
was definitely replaced by the prosaic cycle of Indictions. Yet Athens
still remained a bulwark of the old religion, and the preservation of
that city from the great earthquake which devastated large parts of
Greece in 375 was attributed to the miraculous protection of the hero
Achilles, whose statue had been placed in the Parthenon by the
venerable hierophant of the Eleusinian mysteries.</p>

<p>But a worse evil than earthquakes was about to befall the Greeks.
After more than a century’s peace, the Goths crossed the Balkans
and defeated the Emperor Valens in the battle of Adrianople. The
Greek provinces, entrusted for their better defence to the strong arm
of Theodosius, escaped for the moment with no further loss than that
caused by a Gothic raid in the North and by the brigandage which
is the natural result of every war in the Balkan Peninsula. But, on
the death of that Emperor and the final division of the Roman Empire
between his sons, Honorius and Arcadius, in 395, the Goths, under
their great leader, Alaric, attacked the now divided Prefecture of
Illyricum. The evil results of the complete separation of the Eastern
from the Western Empire were at once felt. The Greek provinces,
which had just been attached to the Eastern system, might have been
saved from this incursion if the Western general, Stilicho, had been
permitted by Byzantine jealousy to rout the Goths in Thessaly. As
the arm of that great commander was thus arrested in the act of
striking, Alaric not only was able to penetrate into Epeiros as far as
Nikopolis, which at that time almost entirely belonged to St Jerome’s
friend, the devout Paula, but he marched over Pindos into Thessaly,
defeated the local militia, and turned to the South upon Bœotia and
Attica. The last earthquake had laid many of the fortifications in ruins,
the Roman army of occupation was small, and its commander unwilling
to imitate the conduct of Leonidas at Thermopylæ. The monks facilitated
the inroad of a Christian army. The famous fortifications of Thebes had
been restored, but they did not check the course of the impetuous Goth,
who, leaving them unassailed, went straight to Athens. A later pagan
historian has invented the pleasing legend that Pallas Athena and the
hero Achilles appeared to protect the city from the invaders. But the
Goths, who were not only Christians but Arian heretics, would have
been little influenced by such an apparition. Athens capitulated, and
Alaric, who bade spare the holy sanctuaries of the Apostles when,
fifteen years later, he entered Rome, abstained from destroying the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
artistic treasures of which Athens was full. But the great temple of
the mysteries at the town of Eleusis, and that town itself, so intimately
associated with that ancient cult, were sacrificed either to the fanaticism
of the Arian monks who followed the Gothic army, to the cupidity
of the troops, or to both. The last hierophant seems to have perished
with the shrine, of which he was the guardian, and a pagan apologist
saw in his fall the manifest wrath of the gods, angry at the usurpation
of that high office by one who did not belong to the sacred family of
the Eumolpidæ. Henceforth the Eleusinian mysteries ceased to exist,
and the home of those great festivals is now a sorry Albanian village,
where ruins still mark the work of the destroyer. Megara shared the
fate of Eleusis, the Isthmus was left without defenders, and Corinth,
Argos, and Sparta were sacked. Those who resisted were cut down,
their wives carried off into slavery, their children made to serve a
Gothic master. Even a philosopher died of a broken heart at the
spectacle of this terrible calamity. Fortunately, Alaric’s sojourn in the
Peloponnese was shortened by the arrival of Stilicho with an army in
the Gulf of Corinth. The Goths withdrew to the fastnesses of Mount
Pholoe, between Olympia and Patras, and it seemed as if Stilicho had
only to draw his lines around them and then wait for hunger to do its
work. But from some unexplained cause—perhaps a court intrigue at
Constantinople, perhaps the negligence of the general—Alaric was
allowed to escape over the Gulf of Corinth into Epeiros. After devastating
that region he was rewarded by the Government of Constantinople
with the office of Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces in the
Eastern half of Illyricum, which comprised the scenes of his recent
ravages. The principle of converting a brigand into a policeman has
often proved successful, but there were probably many who shared the
indignant feelings of the poet Claudian<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> at this sudden transformation
of “the devastator of Achaia” into her protector. But Alaric could
not rebuild the cities, which he had destroyed; he could not restore
prosperity to the lands, which he had ravaged. We have ample evidence
of the injury which this invasion had inflicted upon Greece in the
legislation of Theodosius II in the first half of the next century. Two
Imperial edicts remitted sixty years’ arrears of taxation; another
granted the petition of the people of Achaia that their taxes might be
reduced to one-third of the existing amount on the ground that they
could pay no more; while yet another relieved the Greeks from the
burden of contributing towards the expenses of the public games at
Constantinople. There is proof, too, in the pages of a contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
historian, as well as in the dry paragraphs of the Theodosian Code,
that much of the land had been allowed to go out of cultivation and
had been abandoned by its owners. Athens, however, had survived
the tempest which had laid waste so large a part of the country. True,
we find the philosopher Synesios, who visited that seat of learning
soon after Alaric’s invasion, writing sarcastically to a correspondent,
that Athens “resembled the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered
victim,” and was now famous for its honey alone. But the disillusioned
visitor makes no mention of the destruction of the buildings, for which
the city was renowned. Throughout the vicissitudes of the five and a
half centuries, which we have traversed since the Roman Conquest,
one conqueror after another had spared the glories of Athens, and even
after the terrible calamity of this Gothic invasion she remained the
one bright spot amid the darkness which had settled down upon the land
of the Hellenes.</p>

</div>

<p>The period of more than a century which separated Alaric’s invasion
from the accession of Justinian was not prolific of events on the
soil of Greece. But those which occurred there tended yet further to
accelerate the decay of the old classic life. Scarcely had the country
begun to recover from the long-felt ravages of the Goths, than the
Vandals, who had now established themselves in Africa, plundered the
west and south-west coasts of Greece from Epeiros to Cape Matapan.
But at this crisis the Free Laconian town of Kainepolis showed such
a Spartan spirit that the Vandal King Genseric was obliged to retire
with considerable loss. He revenged himself by ravaging the beautiful
island of Zante, and by throwing into the Ionian Sea the mangled
bodies of 500 of its inhabitants<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. Nikopolis was held as a hostage by
the Vandals till peace was concluded between them and the Eastern
Empire, when their raids ceased. Seven years afterwards, in 482, the
Ostrogoths under Theodoric devastated Larissa and the rich plain of
Thessaly. In 517 a more serious, because permanent enemy, appeared
for the first time in the annals of Greece. The Bulgarians had already
caused such alarm to the statesmen of Constantinople that they had
strengthened the defences of that city, and it was probably at this
time that the fortifications of Megara were restored. On their first
inroad, however, the Bulgarians penetrated no further into Greece
than Thermopylæ and the south of Epeiros. But they carried off
many captives, and, to complete the woes of the Greeks, one of
those severe earthquakes to which that country is liable laid Corinth
in ruins.</p>

<p>The final separation of the Eastern and Western Empires tended
to identify the interests of the Greeks with those of the Eastern
Emperors, to make Greek the language of the Court, and to encourage
the Greek nationality. But from that period down to the Latin conquest
of Constantinople, the Imperial city grew more and more in importance
at the expense of the old home of the Hellenes, and Greece became
more and more provincial. But it seems an exaggeration to say with
Finlay that during those eight centuries “no Athenian citizen gained a
place of honour in the annals of the Empire.” To Athens, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
belongs the honour of having produced the Empress Eudokia, wife of
Theodosius II, whose acts of financial justice to her native land she
may have prompted, such as that which, in 435, reduced the tribute
of the dwellers in Greece by two-thirds, while she is said to have founded
twelve churches in her native city, among them the quaint little
Kapnikarea, so conspicuous a feature of modern Athens, if we may
trust the belief embodied in the inscription inside. The daughter of
an Athenian professor, Leontios, celebrated alike for her beauty and
accomplishments, she went to Constantinople to appeal against an
unjust decision which had enriched her brothers but had left her almost
penniless. She lost her case, but she won the favour of Pulcheria,
the masterful sister of Theodosius, and was appointed one of her maids
of honour. She used this favourable position to the best advantage,
gained the heart of the young Emperor, who was seven years her junior
in age and many more in knowledge of the world, and had no scruples
about exchanging paganism and the name of Athenais for Christianity
and the baptismal title of Eudokia. She showed her Christian charity
by forgiving and promoting her brothers; she kept up her literary
accomplishments by turning part of the Old Testament into Greek
verse; but she was accused of ambition and infidelity, the latter charge
being substantiated by a superb apple, which the Emperor had presented
to his wife, which she in turn had sent to her lover, and he, like
an idiot, had placed on the Emperor’s table! She died in exile at
Jerusalem, a striking example of the vicissitudes of human fortunes.
Yet even in the time of her power, she could not, perhaps would not,
prevent her husband’s persecution of the religion which she had abjured.
His orders to the provincial authorities to destroy the temples or to
consecrate them to Christian worship were not always carried out, it
is true. But the pictures of Polygnotus, which Pausanias had seen in
the Stoa Poikile at Athens, excited the covetousness of an Imperial
governor, and the gold and ivory statue of Athena by Phidias vanished
from the Parthenon for ever<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; the temple of Zeus at Olympia was
destroyed by an earthquake or by Christian bigotry, the shrine of
Asklepios on the slope of the Akropolis was pulled down, while the
heathen divinities became gradually assimilated with the Christian
saints, in whom they finally merged. Thus Helios, the sun-god, was
converted into Elias, whose name is so prominent all over the map of
modern Greece; the wine-god Dionysos became a reformed character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
in the person of St Dionysios, and the temples of Theseus and Zeus
Olympios at Athens were dedicated to St George and St John. By a
still more striking transformation the Parthenon was consecrated as
a church of the Virgin during the sixth century, and was thenceforth
regarded as the Cathedral of Athens. The growth of Christianity is
observable, too, from the lists of Greek sees represented at the Councils
of Ephesus and Chalcedon, while the importance of Corinth as the seat
of the Metropolitan of Achaia is shown by the synod which was held
there to settle a point of Church discipline in 419. In spite, however,
of its political separation from Rome, we find Greece making appeals
to the Pope when grave theological questions arose. At this period
the Archbishop of Salonika was regarded as the official head of all the
Greek provinces in Europe, yet when he seemed to the orthodox
Epeirotes to be affected with heresy, they sent in their adhesion to
Rome.</p>

<p>Theodosius II was not content with the destruction of temples;
he desired the final disappearance of such vestiges of municipal freedom
as Constantine had spared. In the same spirit of uniformity in which
he codified the law, he swept away the remains of Lycurgus’ system
at Sparta and the Court of Areopagos. Yet, as institutions usually
survive their practical utility in a conservative country, we are not
surprised to find the name of an Eponymos Archon as late as 485. And
the University of Athens still lived on, fighting the now hopeless battle
of the old religion with all the zeal of the latest Neo-Platonic school
of philosophy. The endowments of that school and the patriotism
of rich Athenians, like Theagenes, one of the two last Archons,
and known as the wealthiest Greek of his day, made up for the withdrawal
of Imperial subsidies, and the bitter tongue of Synesios could
still complain of the airs which those who had studied at Athens gave
themselves ever afterwards. “They regard themselves,” wrote the
philosopher, “as demi-gods and the rest of mankind as donkeys.”
But the university received a severe blow when, in 425, Theodosius
enlarged and enriched the University of Constantinople with a number
of new professorial chairs. If his institution of fifteen professors of
the Greek language and literature gave that tongue an official position
in what had hitherto been mainly a Latin city, it also attracted the
best talent—men like Jacobus, the famous physician of the Emperor
Leo the Great—from Greece to Constantinople, which thus acted as
a magnet to the aspiring provincials, just as Paris acts to the rest of
France. The last great figure of the Athenian University, Proklos,
whose commentaries on Plato are still extant, was engaged in demonstrating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
by the purity of his life and his doctrines
that a pagan could be no less moral and more intellectual than a
Christian. The old gods, deposed from their thrones, seemed to favour
their last champion; so, when the statue of Athena was removed from
the Akropolis, the goddess appeared to the philosopher in a dream and
told him that henceforth his house would be her home. The famous
Bœthius, whose <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> was translated by our King
Alfred, is thought to have studied at Athens in the last years of Proklos,
and earlier in the fifth century the charming Hypatia, whom Kingsley
has immortalised for English readers, may be numbered among the
ladies who at that time sought higher education at Athens and softened
by their presence the rough manners of the masculine students. But,
with the death of Proklos, the cause of polytheism and the prosperity
of the university declined yet more. The shrewd young Greeks saw
that there was no longer a career for pagans; even the rich benefactor
of Athens, Theagenes, was converted to Christianity. Justinian dealt
the university its death-blow in 529 by decreeing that no one should
teach philosophy at Athens, and by confiscating the endowments of
the Platonic school. Seven philosophers, of whom the most celebrated
was Simplikios, the Aristotelian commentator, resolved to seek under
the benevolent despotism of Chosroes, King of Persia, that freedom of
speech which was denied to them by Justinian. They believed at a
distance that the barbarian monarch had realised the ideal of Plato—a
philosopher on the throne; they went to his court and were speedily
disillusioned. Home-sick and heart-broken, they begged their new
patron to let them return to die in Greece. Chosroes, who was at the
time engaged in negotiating a treaty of peace with Justinian, inserted
a clause allowing the unhappy seven “to pass the rest of their days
without persecution in their native land,” and Simplikios was thus
enabled, in the obscurity of private life, to compose those commentaries
which are still studied by disciples of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Thus perished the
University of Athens, and with it paganism vanished from Greece,
save where, in the mountains of Laconia, it lingered on till beyond
the middle of the ninth century. The ancient name of “Hellenes”
was now exclusively applied to the remnant which still adhered to
the old religion, so much so that Constantine Porphyrogenitus<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in the
tenth century called the Peloponnesian Greeks “Graikoi,” because
“Hellenes” would have still meant idolaters. All the subjects of
Justinian were collectively described as “Romans,” while those who
inhabited Greece came gradually to be specified as “Helladikoi.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>The reign of Justinian marked the annihilation of the ancient life
in other ways than these. He disbanded the provincial militia, to which
we have several times alluded, and which down to his time furnished
a guard for the Pass of Thermopylæ. This garrison proved, however,
unable to keep out the Huns and Slavs who invaded Greece in 539,
and, like the Persians of old, marched through the Pass of Anopaia
into the rear of the defenders. The ravages of these barbarians, who
devasted Central Greece and penetrated as far as the Isthmus, led
Justinian to repair the fortifications of Thermopylæ, where he placed
a regular force of 2000 men, maintained out of the revenues of Greece.
He also re-fortified the Isthmus, and put such important positions as
Larissa, Pharsalos, Corinth, Thebes, and Athens, with the Akropolis,
in a state of proper defence. But these military measures involved a
large expenditure, which Justinian met by appropriating the municipal
funds. The effect of this measure was to deprive the municipal doctors
and teachers of their means of livelihood, to stop the municipal grants
to theatres and other entertainments, to make the repair of public
buildings and the maintenance of roads—the greatest of all needs in
a country with the geographical configuration of Greece—most difficult.
The old Greek life had centred in the municipality, so that from this
blow it never recovered; fortunately, the Church was now sufficiently
well organised to take its place, and henceforth that institution became
the depository of the national traditions, the mainstay in each successive
century of the national existence. Yet another loss to Greece was that
of the monuments, which were taken to Constantinople to make good
the ravages of the great conflagration, caused by the <i>Nika</i> sedition.
The present church of Sta Sophia, which Justinian raised out of the
ashes of the second, was adorned with pillars from Athens as well as
marble from the Greek quarries, and thus once again, as St Jerome had
said, other cities were “stripped naked” to clothe Constantinople.
Earthquakes, which shook Patras, Corinth, and Naupaktos to their
foundations, completed the destruction of much that was valuable,
and the bubonic plague swept over the country, recalling those terrors
of which Thucydides and Lucretius had left such a striking description
in their accounts of the pestilence at Athens in the days of Perikles.
The King of the Ostrogoths, Totila, after twice taking Rome, sent a
fleet to harry Corfù and the opposite coast of Epeiros, plundered
Nikopolis and the ancient shrine of Dodona. It was in consequence
of this and similar raids that the Corfiotes finally abandoned their old
city and took refuge in the present citadel, called later on in the tenth
century from its twin peaks (Κορυφοί) Corfù, instead of Corcyra. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Bulgarians, a few years later, made a fresh raid as far as Thermopylæ,
where they were stopped by the new fortifications. In short, the
ambitious foreign policy of Justinian, the powers of nature, and the
increasing boldness of the barbarians, contrived to make this period
fatal to Greece. Yet the Emperor bestowed one signal benefit upon
that country. By the importation of silkworms he gave the Greeks
the monopoly, so far as Christendom was concerned, of a valuable
manufacture, which was not infringed till the Norman invasion six
centuries later.</p>

<p>The history of Greece becomes very obscure after the death of
Justinian, and the historian must be content to piece together from
the Byzantine writers such stray allusions as those chroniclers of court
scandals make to the neglected fatherland of the Greeks. The salient
fact of this period is the recurrence of the Slav invasions of Justinian’s
time. We learn that in 578 or 581 an army of 100,000 Slavonians
“ravaged Hellas” and Thessaly<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; in 589, under the Emperor Maurice,
the Avars, according to the contemporary historian, Evagrios, “conquered
all Greece, destroying and burning everything<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.” This passage
has given rise to a famous controversy, which at one time convulsed
not only the learned, but the diplomatic world. In 1830 a German
scholar, Professor Fallmerayer, published the first volume of a <i>History
of the Peninsula Morea during the Middle Ages</i>, in which he advanced
the astounding theory that the inhabitants of modern Greece have
“not a single drop of genuine Greek blood in their veins.” “The Greek
race in Europe,” he wrote, “has been rooted out. A double layer of
the dust and ashes of two new and distinct human species covers the
graves of that ancient people. A tempest, such as has seldom arisen
in human history, has scattered a new race, allied to the great Slav
family, over the whole surface of the Balkan peninsula from the Danube
to the inmost recesses of the Peloponnese. And a second, perhaps no
less important revolution, the Albanian immigration into Greece, has
completed the work of destruction.” The former of these two foreign
settlements in the Peloponnese, that of the Slavs and Avars, was
supposed by Fallmerayer to have taken place as the result of the
above-mentioned invasion of 589, and his supposition received plausible
confirmation from a mediæval document. The Patriarch Nicholas,
writing towards the end of the eleventh century to the Emperor
Alexios I Comnenos, alludes to the repulse of the Avars from before
the walls of Patras in 807, and adds that they “had held possession of
the Peloponnese for 218 years (<i>i.e.</i> from 589), and had so completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
separated it from the Byzantine Empire that no Byzantine official
dared to set his foot in it<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.” A similar statement from the <i>Chronicle of
Monemvasia</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>—a late and almost worthless compilation—was also
unearthed by the zealous Fallmerayer, who accordingly believed that
he had proved the existence of a permanent settlement of the Peloponnese
by the Slavs and Avars between 589 and 807, “in complete
independence of the Byzantine governors of the coast.” It was in the
coast-towns alone and in a few other strongholds, such as Mt Taygetos,
that he would allow of any survival of the old Greek race, and he
triumphantly pointed to the famous name of “Navarino” as containing
a fresh proof of an Avar settlement, while in many places he found
Slavonic names, corresponding to those of Russian villages. Another
evidence of this early Slavonic settlement seemed to be provided by
the remark of the very late Byzantine writer, Phrantzes, that his
native city of Monemvasia on the south-east coast, which used to supply
our ancestors’ cellars with malmsey, was separated from the diocese
of Corinth and raised to the rank of a metropolitan see about this
identical time, presumably because many Greeks had taken refuge there
from the Slavs, and were cut off from Corinth. Finally, a nun, who
composed an account of the pilgrimage of St Willibald, the Anglo-Saxon
Bishop of Eichstätt, in 723, stated that he “crossed to Monemvasia
in the Slavonian land,” an expression which Fallmerayer hailed
as a proof that at that period the Peloponnese was known by that
name. It need not be said that Fallmerayer’s theory was as flattering
to Panslavism as it was unpleasant to Philhellenes. But it is no longer
accepted in its full extent. No one who has been in Greece can fail to
have been struck by the similarity between the character of the modern
and the ancient Greeks. Many an island has its “Odysseus of many
wiles”; every morning and evening the Athenians are anxious to hear
“some new thing”; and the comedies of Aristophanes contain many
personal traits which fit the subjects of the present king. Nor does
even the vulgar language contain any considerable Slavonic element,
although there are a certain number of Slavonic place-names to be
found on the map, including perhaps Navarino. Moreover, the contemporary
historian, Theophylact Simokatta, makes no mention of
the invasion of 589, though he minutely describes the wars of that
period. Yet, as we shall see later, there is no doubt that at one time
there was a great Slavonic immigration into Greece, but it took place
about 746, instead of in 589, and the incoming Slavs, so far from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
annihilating the Greeks, were gradually assimilated by that persistent
race, as has happened to conquering peoples elsewhere.</p>

<p>But Fallmerayer was not content with wiping out the Greeks
from the Peloponnese. He next propounded the amazing statement
that the history of Athens was a blank for four centuries after the time
of Justinian, and explained this strange phenomenon by a Slavonic
inundation in that Emperor’s reign. In consequence of this invasion,
the Athenians were said to have fled to Salamis, where they remained
for 400 years, while their city was abandoned to olive groves and utterly
neglected. These “facts,” which the learned German had culled from
the chronicle of the Anargyroi Monastery<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, which, however, distinctly
says “three years,” and not 400, and refers to Albanians, not Slavs,
have since been disproved, not only by the obviously modern date
of that compilation, which is now assigned to the nineteenth century,
and which refers to the temporary abandonment of Athens after its
capture by Morosini in 1687, but by the allusions which may be found
to events at Athens during this period of supposed desertion. Thus,
we hear of an heretical bishop being sent there towards the end of the
sixth century, and we have the seal of the orthodox divine who was
Bishop of Athens a hundred years later<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. An eloquent appeal was
made by the Byzantine historian, Theophylact Simokatta, to the city to
put on mourning for the Emperor Maurice, who died in 602, and sixty
years later another Emperor, Constans II, landed at the Piræus on his
way to Sicily, spent the winter at Athens, and collected there a considerable
force of soldiers. Even some few traces of culture may be
found there in the century which followed Justinian’s closing of the
university. St Gislenus, who went as a missionary to Hainault, and a
learned doctor, named Stephen, were both born at Athens, and the
former is stated to have studied there. Finally, in the middle of the
eighth century, the famous Empress Irene first saw the light in the city,
which had already given one consort to an Emperor of the East. Thus,
if comparatively obscure, Athens was not a mere collection of ruins
in an olive grove, but a city of living men and women which had never
(as Zygomalas wrote to Crusius in the sixteenth century) “remained
desolate for about 300 years.”</p>

<p>The attacks of the Slavs and of the newly-founded Arabian power
marked the course of the seventh century. In 623 the Slavs made
an incursion into Crete, and that island, of which we have heard little
under the Imperial rule, was also visited by the Arabs in 651 and 674.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
But though the Cretans were forced to pay tribute to the Caliph,
Moawyah, they were treated with kindness by the politic conqueror.
About the same time as this second Arab invasion, and while the main
Arab force was besieging Constantinople, a body of Slavs seized the
opportunity to settle in the rich plain of Thessaly, and it is from one
of their tribes that the present town of Velestino, so often mentioned
in the war of 1897, received its name. Yet this tribe soon became so
friendly that it assisted the Greeks in the defence of Salonika against
a Slavonic army—a further proof of the readiness with which the Slavs
adopted the Greek point of view. It is clear also that the command
of the Imperial troops in Greece was regarded as an important post,
for we find it entrusted to Leontios, who made himself Emperor. The
Greek islands were still used as places of detention for prisoners of
position. Thus Naxos was chosen as the temporary exile of Pope
Martin I by the Emperor Constans II, and the future Emperor Philippicus
was banished to Cephalonia.</p>

<p>A new era opened for the Empire with the accession of Leo the
Isaurian in 716. In the first place, that sovereign completed the reform
of the system of provincial administration, which had lasted more or
less continuously since the time of Constantine. In place of the old
provincial divisions, the Empire was now parcelled out into military
districts, called Themes—a name originally applied to a regiment and
then to the place at which the regiment was quartered. The choice
of such a title indicates the essentially military character of the new
arrangement, which implied the maintenance of a small division of
troops in each district as a necessary defence against the Avars, Slavs,
and Arabs, whose depredations had menaced provinces seldom exposed
to attack in the old times. Six out of the twenty-eight Themes comprised
Greece, as she was before the late Balkan wars. The Peloponnese,
with its capital of Corinth, formed one; Central Greece, including
Eubœa, formed another, under the name of Hellas, but its capital was
Thebes, not Athens; Nikopolis, which comprised Ætolia and Akarnania,
and Cephalonia (the latter created a separate Theme later on, and
including all the Ionian Islands) were two more; the Ægean Sea,
popularly known as the Dodekannesos, or “twelve islands,” composed
one of the Asian Themes, and Thessaly was a part of the Theme of
Macedonia. Both the military and civil authority in each Theme was
vested in the hands of a Commander, known as <i>strategós</i>, except in
the case of the Ægean Islands, where the post was filled by an Admiral,
called <i>droungários</i>. Under the <i>strategós</i> were the <i>protonotários</i> or “judge,”
who was a judicial and administrative authority, and two military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
personages, one of whom, the <i>kleisourárches</i>, was so-called because he
watched the mountain passes, like the later Turkish <i>derben-aga</i>. So
far as Greece is concerned, the eclipse of Athens by Thebes, perhaps
owing to the silk industry for which the latter city was famous in
the Middle Ages, is a very noticeable feature of the new administration.</p>

<p>Another reform of Leo the Isaurian aroused the intense indignation
of the inhabitants of Greece. We have seen that the spread of Christianity
in that country had been facilitated by the assimilation of
pagan forms of worship in the new ritual. It was natural that a race,
which had been accustomed for centuries to connect art with religion
and to seek the noblest statuary in the temples of the gods, should have
regarded with peculiar favour the practice of hanging pictures in
churches. When therefore Leo, whose Armenian origin perhaps made
him personally unsympathetic to the Greeks, issued an edict against
image-worship, his orders met with the most bigoted resistance in
Greece. It may be that a more searching census for the purposes of
the revenue had already rendered him unpopular; but to those who
know how strong is the influence of the Church in the East, and what
fierce disputes an ecclesiastical question kindles there, the edict of
the Emperor will seem ample ground for the Greek rising of 727. An
eruption at the volcanic island of Santorin was interpreted as a sign
of divine displeasure at the doings of the iconoclast sovereign; while
Pope Gregory II addressed two violent missives to the Emperor, and
probably encouraged the agitation in Greece, which still acknowledged
him as spiritual head of the Church. The “Helladikoi,” as they were
now called, and the seamen of the Cyclades fitted out a fleet under the
leadership of a certain Stephen; and, with the co-operation of Agallianos,
one of the Imperial military officials, set up an orthodox Emperor,
named Kosmas, and boldly set sail for Constantinople—a proof of
the resources of Greece at this period. But the result of this naval
undertaking was very different from that which Greece had equipped
on behalf of Constantine. A battle was fought under the walls of the
capital between the two fleets. The Emperor Leo, availing himself
of the terrible invention of the Greek fire, which had been used with
such deadly effect in the recent Saracen siege of Constantinople,
annihilated his opponents’ vessels. Agallianos, seeing that all was lost,
leaped into the sea; Stephen and Kosmas fell by the axe of the executioner.
We are not told what punishment was meted out to the Greeks,
but, in consequence of the strong attitude of opposition which the
Papacy had taken up to the Emperor, Leo in 732 deprived the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
of all jurisdiction over Greece, and placed that country under the
ecclesiastical authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>

<p>The next important event in the history of Greece was the great
plague, which broke out at Monemvasia in 746 and spread all over
the Empire. The political consequences of this visitation were far-reaching.
For not only was the population of Greece diminished by
the increased mortality there, but it was further lessened by emigration
to Constantinople, where there were openings for plasterers and other
skilled workmen, and where great numbers had died of the epidemic.
The place of these emigrants in the Peloponnese was taken by Slav
colonists, and this is the true explanation of the Slavonic colonisation,
which Fallmerayer placed so much earlier. In the celebrated words of
the Imperial author, Constantine Porphyrogenitus, “All the open
country was Slavonised and became barbarous, when the plague was
devouring the whole world<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.” It seems from the phrase “open country,”
that such Greeks as remained behind crowded into the towns, and that
the rural districts were thus left free for the Slavs to occupy. And
this is confirmed by the <i>Epitome of Strabo’s Geography</i>, compiled
apparently about the end of the tenth century, which states that at
that time “All Epeiros and a large part of Hellas and the Peloponnese
and Macedonia were inhabited by Scythian Slavs.” The memory of
this Slavonic occupation has been preserved by the Slavonic names of
places, which Colonel Leake was the first to notice. That the Slavs
excited the alarm of the Byzantine government is clear from the fact
that in 783 Staurakios was despatched by the Empress Irene to crush
their efforts at independence. The Empress was actuated by love of
Greece as well as by motives of policy, for she was a native of Athens,
like her predecessor, Eudokia. At the age of seventeen she had been
selected by the Emperor Constantine Copronymos as the wife of his
son, Leo IV, and the premature death of her husband left her the real
mistress of the Empire, which she governed, first as Regent for her son
and then as sole ruler, for over twenty years. One of the earliest acts
of her Regency was to send the expedition against the Slavs. Those in
Thessaly and Central Greece were forced to pay tribute; those in the
Peloponnese yielded a rich booty to the Byzantine commander. But
the Slavs were not permanently subdued, as was soon evident. Irene,
for the greater security of her throne, had banished her five brothers-in-law
to Athens, which was, of course, devoted to her, and was at
that time governed by one of her kinsmen. But the five prisoners
managed to communicate with Akamir, a Slav chieftain who lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
at Velestino, and a plot was formed for the elevation of them to the
throne. The plans of the conspirators fell into the hands of Irene’s
friends, and the prisoners were removed to a safer place. Irene, however,
was dethroned a little later by Nikephoros I, and banished to Mitylene,
where she died. In spite of her appalling treatment of her son, whom
she had dethroned and blinded in order to gratify her greed of power,
tradition states that she showed her piety and patriotism by the
foundation of several churches at Athens. Some of her foundations
disappeared in the storm and stress of the War of Independence;
others were removed to make way for the streets of the modern town; but
the Church of the Panagia Gorgoepekoos, or so-called old Metropolis<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
which still stands, is ascribed to her, and the ruins of the monastery
which she built and where she at one time lived strew the beautiful
island of Prinkipo. Even with her death her native city did not lose
its connection with the Byzantine Court. Among her surviving relatives
at Athens was a beautiful niece, Theophano, who was married to a
man of position there. Nikephoros, anxious, no doubt, like all usurpers,
to connect his family with that of the Sovereign whom he had deposed,
resolved that the fair Athenian should become the consort of his son,
Staurakios. He accordingly snatched her from the arms of her husband
and brought her to Constantinople, where her second marriage took
place. But this third Athenian Empress did not long enjoy the reward
of her infidelity to her first husband. Staurakios survived his father’s
death at the hands of the Bulgarians a very few months, and his consort,
like Eudokia and Irene, ended her life in a monastery.</p>

<p>The Slavs of the Peloponnese believed that their chance of
obtaining independence had come during the troubled reign of Nikephoros,
when the Saracens under Haroun Al Rashid and the growing
power of the Bulgarians menaced the Byzantine Empire. They
accordingly rose, and, after plundering the houses of their Greek
neighbours, laid siege in 807 to the fortress of Patras, which was the
principal stronghold of the old inhabitants in the north-west of the
country. The Slavs blockaded the city from the land side, while a
Saracen fleet prevented the introduction of supplies by sea. The besieged,
knowing that the fate of Hellenism in the Peloponnese depended on
their efforts, held out against these odds in the hope that they would
thus give the Imperial commander at Corinth time to relieve them.
At last, when all hope of deliverance seemed to have disappeared, they
sent out a horseman to one of the hills in the direction of Corinth
to see if the longed for army of relief was in sight. His orders were to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
gallop back as soon as he caught a glimpse of the approaching
Imperialists and to lower the flag which he carried, so that his comrades
in Patras might have the glad news at once. But his eyes in vain
searched the road along the Gulf of Corinth for the gleam of weapons
or the dust that would announce the march of soldiers. Sadly he
turned his horse towards Patras, when, at a spot where he was in full
view of the walls, his steed stumbled and the flag fell. The besieged,
believing that help was at hand, were inspired with fresh courage,
and, sallying from the gates, inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Slavs,
which was followed up after the arrival of the relieving force three
days later by the restoration of the Imperial authority along the west
coast. At that age so great a victory was naturally ascribed to superhuman
aid. St Andrew, the patron-saint of Patras, who, as we have
seen, was believed to have suffered martyrdom there, and whose
relics were then preserved there, had caused the scout’s horse to
stumble and had been seen on a milk-white steed leading the citizens
in their successful onslaught on the Slavs<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. The gratitude, or policy, of
the government showed itself in the dedication of the spoil and captives
to the service of the church of St Andrew, and the Slavonic peasants
of the neighbourhood became its tenants and paid it a yearly rent.
The Archbishop of Patras, who had hitherto been dependent upon
Corinth, was raised by Nikephoros to the rank of a Metropolitan, and
Methone, Korone and Lacedæmon, were placed under his immediate
jurisdiction. The political object and result of this step, which was
ratified by later Emperors, was to hellenise the vanquished Slavs by
means of the Greek clergy. Moreover, the policy of Nikephoros in
organising Greek military colonies round the Slav settlements in Greece,
tended to check Slavonic raids. Public lands were bestowed on these
colonists whose establishment contributed much to the ultimate fusion
of the two races. Thus, the defeat of the Slavs before Patras and the
wise measures of Nikephoros prevented the Peloponnese from becoming
a Slavonic State, like Servia or Bulgaria, and from that date the tide,
which had at one time threatened to submerge the Greek nationality
there, began to ebb. Of this phenomenon we shall be able to watch
the progress.</p>

<p>A generation elapsed without a renewal of the Slav agitation in
the Peloponnese; but about 849 a fresh rising took place. On this
occasion the appearance of a Byzantine commander in the field soon
caused the collapse of the rebels. Two Slavonic tribes, however, the
Melings and Ezerits, which inhabited the slopes to the west, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
plain to the east of Mount Taygetos, were enabled by the strength
of their geographical position to make terms with the Byzantine
government, and agreed to pay a small tribute which was assessed
according to their respective means<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. The Church continued the work
of the soldiers by building monasteries in the Slavonic districts, and
from the middle of the ninth century the Greek element began to
recover lost ground. Nearly all the Slavs and the last of the Hellenic
pagans in the south of Taygetos were then converted, and the adoption
of Christianity by the Bulgarians cannot have failed to affect the
Slavonic settlers in the Byzantine Empire. Of the revived prosperity
of Greece we have two remarkable proofs. In 823 that country raised
a fleet of 350 sail for the purpose of intervening in the civil war then
raging between the Emperor Michael the Stammerer and a Slavonic
usurper, and this implies the possession of considerable resources. Still
more striking is the story of the rich widow, Danielis of Patras. About
the time of the Byzantine expedition against the Slavs of Taygetos,
the future Emperor, Basil I, then chief groom in the service of a
prominent courtier, was at Patras in attendance on his master, who had
been sent there on political business. One day, as the comely groom
was entering the church of St Andrew, a monk stopped him and told
him that he should become Emperor. Shortly afterwards he fell ill
of a fever, which, by detaining him at Patras after his master’s departure,
proved to be a blessing in disguise. Moved by philanthropy or the
prophecy of the monk, Danielis took the sick groom into her house,
bade him be a brother to her son, and, when he had recovered from
his illness, provided him with a train of thirty slaves to accompany
him to Constantinople, and loaded him with costly presents. When,
in 867, the monk’s forecast was fulfilled, and Basil mounted the
Imperial throne, he did not forget his benefactress. He not only
promoted her son to a high position in his court, but invited the aged
lady to Constantinople. In spite of her age and infirmities, Danielis
travelled in a litter, accompanied by 300 slaves, who took in turns
the duty of carrying their mistress. As a gift to the Emperor, she
brought 500 more, as well as 100 maidens, chosen for their skill in
embroidery, 100 purple garments, 300 linen robes, and 100 more of
such fine material that each piece could easily be packed away in a
hollow cane. Every kind of gold and silver vessel completed the list
of presents, which would not have disgraced a brother sovereign.
When she arrived, she was lodged like a queen and addressed as
“mother” by her grateful <i>protégé</i>. Basil’s gratitude was rewarded by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
fresh favours. Danielis called for a notary and made over to the
Emperor and her own son a part of her landed estates in the Peloponnese.
Finding that Basil had tried to atone for the murder of his
predecessor, which had given him the throne, by the erection of a
church, she had a huge carpet manufactured by her own workmen
to cover the splendid mosaic floor. Once again, on the death of her
favourite, she journeyed to Constantinople to greet his son and successor.
Her own son was by that time dead, so she devised the whole
of her property to the young Emperor Leo VI. At her request, a high
official was sent to the Peloponnese to prepare an inventory of her
effects. Even in these days a sovereign would rejoice at such a windfall.
Her loose cash, her gold and silver plate, her bronze ornaments, her
wardrobe, and her flocks and herds represented a princely fortune.
As for her slaves, they were so numerous that the Emperor, in the
embarrassment of his riches, emancipated 3000 of them and sent them
as colonists to Apulia, then part of the Byzantine Empire. Eighty
farms formed the real property of this ninth century millionairess,
whose story throws light on the position of the Peloponnesian landed
class, or <i>archontes</i>, at that period. Danielis was, doubtless, exceptionally
rich, and Patras was then, as now, the chief commercial town in the
Peloponnese. But the existence of such an enormous fortune as hers
presupposes a high degree of civilisation, in which many others must
have participated. Even learning was still cultivated in Greece, for
the distinguished mathematician Leo, who was one of the ornaments
of the Byzantine Court, is expressly stated to have studied rhetoric,
philosophy and science under a famous teacher, Michael Psellos, who
lectured at a college in the island of Andros, where his pupil’s name
is not yet forgotten<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p>But while the Greeks had thus triumphed in the Peloponnese,
they had lost ground elsewhere. Availing themselves of the disorders
in the Byzantine Empire, when the Greek ships were all engaged in
the civil war of 823, a body of Saracens, who had emigrated from the
south of Spain to Alexandria, descended on Crete, at that time recovering
from the effects of an earthquake, but still possessing thirty cities.
Landing at Suda Bay, they found the islanders mostly favourable,
or at any rate indifferent, to a change of masters. Reinforced by a
further batch of their countrymen, the Saracens resolved to settle
there. A Cretan monk is said to have shown them a strong position
where they could pitch their camp; so they burnt their ships and
established themselves at the spot indicated, the site of the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
town of Candia, which derives its Venetian name from the Chandak
or “ditch” surrounding it. The conquest of the island was soon accomplished—a
clear proof of the islanders’ apathy when we remember the
heroic defence of the Cretans in more recent times. Religious toleration
reconciled many to the sway of the Saracens; in the course of years
a number of the Christians embraced the creed of their conquerors,
helping to man their fleets and sharing the profits of that nefarious
traffic in slaves of which Crete, as in former days Delos, became the
centre. One district, which we may identify with Sphakia, was permitted
to enjoy autonomy. For Greece the rule of the Saracens in
Crete was a serious misfortune. Cretan corsairs ably led by Christian
renegades, in quest of booty and slaves, ravaged the Cyclades and the
Ionian Islands, and menaced the coast towns of the mainland, whither
the terrified inhabitants of Ægina and similarly exposed spots migrated
in the hope of safety. The efforts of the Byzantine government to
recover “the great Greek island,” which was now a terror to the whole
Levant, were for more than a century unsuccessful, and during 138
years Crete remained in the possession of the Saracens. Occasionally
their fleet was annihilated, as in the reign of Basil I, when the Byzantine
admiral, hearing that they meditated a descent upon the west coast
of Greece, conveyed his ships across the Isthmus in the night by means
of the old tram-road, or <i>diolkos</i>, which had been used by the contemporaries
of Thucydides, and has even now not entirely disappeared.
By this brilliant device he took the enemy by surprise in the Gulf of
Corinth, and destroyed their vessels. But new fleets arose as if by magic,
and Basil was obliged to strengthen the garrisons of the Peloponnese.
His successor, aroused to action by their daring attacks upon Demetrias
and Salonika, both flourishing cities which they devastated and
plundered, equipped a naval expedition, to which the Greek Themes
contributed ships and men, with the object of recapturing Crete. But
neither that nor the subsequent armada despatched by the Imperial
author, Constantine Porphyrogenitus, was destined to succeed. At
last, in 961, the redoubtable commander, Nikephoros Phokas, restored
Crete to the Byzantine Empire. But even at that early period, Candia
began to establish the reputation which it so nobly increased during
the Turkish siege seven centuries later. Its strong fortifications for
seven long months resisted the Byzantine general; but he patiently
waited for a favourable moment, and at last took the place by storm.
The most drastic measures were adopted for the complete reduction
of the island. The broad brick walls of Candia were pulled down; a
new fortress called Temenos was erected on the height of Rhoka some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
miles inland, to overawe the inhabitants. Some of the Saracens
emigrated, others sank into a state of serfdom. As usual the missionary
followed the Byzantine arms, and the island attracted many Greek
and Armenian Christians; the name of the latter still lingers in the
Cretan village of Armeni; among the former were some distinguished
Byzantine families, whose descendants furnished leaders to the insurrections
later on. In the conversion of the Cretan apostates back to
Christianity, an Armenian monk called Nikon, and nicknamed “Repent
Ye” from the frequency of that phrase in his sermons, found a fine
field for his labours. The Christian churches, for which Crete had once
been famous, rose again, and the reconquest of the island gave to
Nikephoros Phokas the Imperial diadem, to the deacon Theodosios the
subject for a long iambic poem, and to Nikon the more lasting dignity
of a saint. But, in spite of his efforts, not a few Arabs retained their
religion, and the Cretan Mussulmans of Amari are still reckoned as
their descendants.</p>

<p>The tenth century witnessed not only the recovery of Crete for the
Byzantine Empire and for the Christian faith, but also the spread of
monasteries over Greece. When Nikon had concluded his Cretan
mission he visited Athens, where he is said by his biographer to have
enchanted the people with his sermons, penetrated as far as Thebes,
and then returned to Sparta, where he founded a convent and established
his headquarters. Thence he set out on missionary journeys among the
Slavonic tribes of the Melings and Ezerits, who had again risen against
the Imperial authority and had again been reduced to the payment
of a tribute. Those wild clans continued, however, to harry the surrounding
country, and the monastery of St Nikon was only protected
from their attacks by the awe which the holy man’s memory inspired.
Long after his death he was adored as the guardian of Sparta, where
his memory is still green, and the Peloponnesian mariner, caught in
a storm off Cape Matapan, would pray to him, as his ancestors had
prayed to Castor and Pollux. For Central Greece the career of the
blessed Luke the younger was as important as that of St Nikon for
the South. The parents of this remarkable man had fled from Ægina,
when the Cretan corsairs plundered that island, and had taken refuge
in Macedonia, where Luke was born. Filled with the idea that he had
a call to a holy life, the young Luke settled as a hermit on a lonely
Greek mountain by the sea-shore, where for seven long years he devoted
himself to prayer. A Bulgarian raid drove him to the Peloponnese,
where for ten years more he served as the attendant of another hermit,
who, like the famous Stylites of old, lived on a pillar near Patras. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
further adventures, he migrated to Stiris, between Delphi and Livadia,
where the monastery which bears his name now stands.</p>

<p>The absorption of the Christianised Slavs by the Greeks was
occasionally interrupted by the Bulgarian inroads, which now became
frequent. Since the foundation of the first Bulgarian Empire towards
the end of the ninth century, the power of that race had greatly
increased, and the Byzantine sovereigns found formidable rivals in
the Bulgarian tsars. About 929 the Bulgarians captured Nikopolis, and
converted it into a Slavonic colony, which was only reconquered by
considerable efforts. Arsenios, Metropolitan of Corfù, who was canonised
later on, and was for centuries the patron saint of the island, where his
festival is still celebrated and his remains repose, fell into the hands
of these invaders, but was rescued by the valour of the islanders<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>,
and a new tribe, called Slavesians, probably an offshoot of the Bulgarians,
made its way into the Peloponnese. The troublesome clans of Melings
and Ezerits seized this opportunity to demand the reduction of their
tribute, which had been raised after their last rising. The Government
wisely granted their demand, and so prevented a formidable insurrection.
Athens was also disturbed by a domestic riot. A certain Chases,
a high Byzantine official, had aroused the resentment of the people
by his tyranny and the scandals of his life. Alarmed at the threatening
attitude of the inhabitants, who had been joined by others from the
country, he took refuge at the altar in the Church of the Virgin on
the Akropolis, the ancient Parthenon. But the sanctuary did not
protect him from the vengeance of his enemies, who stoned him to
death at the altar, thus showing less reverence for the Virgin than the
ancient Athenians had once shown under somewhat similar circumstances
for the goddess Athena.</p>

<p>The Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, who wrote about the
middle of the tenth century, has left us a favourable sketch of the
Peloponnese as it was in his day. Forty cities were to be found in
that Theme, and some idea of its resources may be formed from the
statement that the Peloponnesians excused themselves from personal
service in an Italian campaign by the payment of 7200 pieces of gold
and the presentation of 1000 horses all equipped<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. The purple, parchment,
and silk industries, as well as the shipping trade, must have
yielded considerable profits to those who carried them on, and the
presence of many Jews at Sparta in the time of St Nikon, who tried
to expel them, shows that there was money to be made there. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
biography represents that city—of which the contemporary Empress,
Theophano, wife of Romanos II and Nikephoros Phokas, was perhaps
a native<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>—as possessing a powerful aristocracy, and as having commercial
relations with Venice. The reconquest of Crete, by freeing the
coast-towns from the depredations of pirates, naturally increased the
prosperity of Greece. Schools rose again at Athens and Corinth, and
from that time down to the beginning of the thirteenth century the
country improved, in spite of occasional invasions. Thus, the Bulgarian
Tsar Samuel captured Larissa and carried off many of its inhabitants,
as well as the remains of the Thessalian Archbishop, St Achilleios,
which had long been the chief relic of the place. His standards were
twice seen south of the Isthmus, and Attica was ravaged by his forces.
To this period we may refer the statement above quoted that “all
Epeiros and a large part of Hellas and the Peloponnese and Macedonia
were occupied by Scythian Slavs.” But when they arrived at the river
Spercheios on their return march, they were surprised by a Byzantine
army and utterly defeated. The Emperor Basil II, surnamed “the
Bulgar-slayer,” completed the destruction of the first Bulgarian
Empire, and on his triumphal progress through Northern and Central
Greece in 1019 found the bones of the slain still bleaching on the banks
of the Spercheios. After inspecting the fortifications of Thermopylæ,
he proceeded to Athens, which no Byzantine Emperor had visited
since the days of Constans II. The visit was an appropriate sequel to
the campaign. For the first time for centuries the Byzantine dominions
extended from the Bosporos to the Danube, and the Balkan peninsula
once again was under Greek domination. In the Church of the Virgin
on the Akropolis, the very centre and shrine of the old Hellenic life
in bygone days, the victorious Emperor offered up thanks to Almighty
God for his successes, and showed his gratitude by rich offerings to
the church out of the spoil which he had taken. The beauty of the
building, which he seems to have enhanced by a series of frescoes,
traces of which are still visible, was justly celebrated in the next
generation, and one curiosity of that holy spot, the ever-burning golden
lamp, is specially mentioned by the author of the so-called <i>Book of
Guido</i>, and by the Icelandic pilgrim, Saewulf. Other persons imitated
the example of Basil, and the restoration or foundation of Athenian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
churches was one of the features of the first half of the eleventh century.
Freed for the time from corsairs and hostile armies, Greece was once
more able to pursue the arts of peace unhindered. During the great
famine which prevailed at Constantinople in 1037, the Themes of Hellas
and the Peloponnese were able to export 100,000 bushels of wheat
for the relief of the capital. The chief grievance of the Greeks was the
extortion of the Imperial Government, which aroused two insurrections
after the death of Basil. The first of these movements took place at
Naupaktos, where the people rose against “Mad George,” the hated
representative of the Emperor, murdered him, and plundered his
residence. This revolt was suppressed with great severity, the archbishop,
who had been on the side of the people, being blinded, according
to the prevalent fashion of Byzantine criminal law. Some years later,
the inhabitants of the Theme of Nikopolis murdered the Imperial
tax-collector, and called in the Bulgarians, who had risen against fiscal
extortion like themselves. While Naupaktos held out in the West, the
Thebans, then a rich and flourishing community, abandoned their silk
manufactories, and took the field against the Bulgarians<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. But they
were defeated with great loss, and it has even been asserted that the
victors occupied the Piræus with the connivance of the discontented
Athenians.</p>

<p>This surmise, which has, however, been rejected by the German
historian of mediæval Athens, rests upon one of the most curious
discoveries that have been made in connection with the place. Every
visitor to Venice has seen the famous lions which adorn the front of
the arsenal. One of these statues, brought home as a trophy by Morosini
from the Piræus in 1688, has upon it a runic inscription, which has
been deciphered by an expert. According to his version, the inscription
commemorates the capture of the Piræus at this period by the celebrated
Harold Hardrada, whom our King Harold defeated at Stamford Bridge,
and who, in 1040, was commander of the Imperial Guard at Constantinople.
In consequence, it appears, of an Athenian rising, Harold had
been sent with a detachment of that force, composed largely of
Norwegians, to put down the rebellion. After accomplishing their
object, the Northmen, in the fashion of the modern tourist, scrawled
their names and achievements on the patient lion, which then stood,
like the lion of Lindau, at the entrance of the Piræus and gave to
that harbour its later name of Porto Leone. It would be difficult
to find a more curious piece of historical evidence than that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
monument in Venice should tell us of a Norwegian descent upon
Athens.</p>

<p>Dissension among the Bulgarians led to their collapse, and Greece
enjoyed a complete freedom from barbarian inroads for the next forty
years, with the exception of a passing invasion by the Uzes, a Turkish
tribe, who left no mark upon the country. Athens at this period was
regarded by the Byzantine officials who were sent there as the uttermost
ends of the earth, though at Constantinople Philhellenism had a worthy
representative in the historian and philosopher Psellos, who constantly
manifested a deep interest in “the muse of Athens.” A more curious
figure, typical of that monastic age, was the Cappadocian monk
Meletios, who established himself on the confines of Attica and Bœotia,
and by means of his miracles gained great influence there. We find him
descending from his solitary mountain to Athens to rescue a band of
Roman pilgrims, who had taken refuge there and had been threatened
with death by the bigoted Athenians. We hear of the convents which
he founded in various parts of Greece, and it was to him that the land
was largely indebted for the plague of monks, many of them merely
robbers in disguise, which checked civic progress and injured all national
life in the next century. Worse than this, the final separation of the
Greek and Latin Churches in 1053, by kindling a fanatical hatred
between West and East, brought countless woes upon the Levant,
and was one of the causes of the Latin invasions which culminated
in the overthrow of the Byzantine Empire in 1204.</p>

<p>There now appeared, for the first time in the history of Greece,
that vigorous race which in the same century conquered our own
island. The Normans of Italy, under their redoubtable leader, Robert
Guiscard, resolved to emulate the doings of William the Conqueror
by subduing the Byzantine Empire, which seemed to those daring
spirits an easy prey. They began by the annexation of the Byzantine
provinces of Apulia and Calabria, and then turned their eyes across
the Adriatic to the opposite coast. An excuse was easily found for this
invasion. One of Guiscard’s daughters had been engaged to the son
of the Emperor Michael VII. But the revolution, which overthrew
Michael, sent his son into a monastery, and thus provided Guiscard
with an opportunity of posing as the champion of the fallen dynasty.
An impostor, who masqueraded as the deposed Emperor, implored
his aid in the cause of legitimacy, and the great Pope, who then
occupied the throne under the name of Gregory VII, bade the godly
help in the contest against the schismatic Greeks. After long preparations
Guiscard appeared in 1081 off Corfù, which surrendered to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Norman invader, and then directed his forces against the walls of
Durazzo, now a crumbling Albanian fortress, then “the Western key
of the empire.” Menaced at the same moment by the Turks in Asia
and the Normans in Europe, the Emperor Alexios I made peace with
the former and then set out to the relief of Durazzo. But he did not
trust to a land force alone, and as the Byzantine navy, like the Turkish
fleet in our own days, had been neglected and the money intended
for its maintenance had been misappropriated, he applied for aid to
the mercantile Republic of Venice. The Venetians saw a chance of
consolidating their trade in the Levant, and, as the price of their
assistance, obtained from the embarrassed Emperor the right of free
trade throughout the empire, where the Greek cities of Thebes, Athens,
Corinth, Nauplia, Methone, Korone, Corfù, Euripos, and Demetrias
are specially mentioned as their haunts. But the aid of a Venetian
fleet did not prevent the victory of the Normans over Alexios on the
plain near Durazzo, where Cæsar and Pompey had once contended.
The Emperor retreated to Ochrida, where, two generations earlier, the
Bulgarian Tsar Samuel had fixed his residence, while his conqueror,
after taking Durazzo, marched across Albania and captured the city
of Kastoria, which was defended by three hundred English, members
of the Imperial Guard. Recalled to Italy by troubles in his own
dominions and by the distress of his ally the Pope, Guiscard left the
prosecution of the campaign to his son Bohemond, who penetrated
into Thessaly, that historic battle-ground of the Near East. But the
walls of Larissa and the gold of Alexios proved too much for the
strength of the Normans, and Bohemond was forced to retire to Italy.
He found his father fresh from his triumph at Rome, which he had
delivered to the Pope, and ready for a second campaign against the
Byzantine Empire. In 1084 Guiscard set sail again; after three naval
battles with the Greeks and their Venetian allies, Corfù once more
surrendered to the Normans, and their leader used it as a stepping-stone
to the island of Cephalonia. But he contracted a fever there, which put
an end to his life and to the expedition, of which he had been the heart and
soul. The village of Phiskardo has perpetuated his name, thus marking
this second attempt of the West to impose its sway upon the East.</p>

<p>Bohemond renewed, twenty-two years later, his father’s attacks
upon the Byzantine Empire. In the meanwhile, as the result of his
share in the first crusade, he had become Prince of Antioch—one of
those feudal States which now adjoined the immediate dominions of
the Eastern Emperor and exercised considerable social influence on
the customs of his subjects. Aided by the Pisans, whose fleet ravaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the Ionian Islands, Bohemond seemed likely to repeat the early successes
of his father; but Alexios had learnt how to deal with the Latins, and
the Normans’ second assault on Durazzo ended in a treaty of peace,
by which Bohemond swore fealty to the Emperor. For the next forty
years Greece had nothing to fear from the Normans, but the evil results
of the alliance with Venice now became manifest. The Republic of
St Mark had jealous commercial rivals in Italy, who envied her the
monopoly of the Levantine trade. When, therefore, concessions were
made to the Pisans and the previous charter of the Venetians was not
renewed, the Empire found itself involved in a naval war with the
latter, from which the defenceless Greek islands suffered, and which
was only ended by the renewal of the old Venetian privileges. The
mercantile powers of Italy had come to treat the Byzantine possessions
much as modern European States regard Turkey, as a Government
from which trading concessions can be obtained. But every fresh grant
offended some one and gave the favoured party more and more influence
in the affairs of the Empire. Fresh Venetian factories were founded in
Greece, and the increasing prosperity of that country had the disadvantage
of attracting the covetous foreigner.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when, in 1146, Guiscard’s nephew,
King Roger of Sicily, availing himself of an insult to his honour,
invaded Greece with far greater success than had attended his uncle.
The Sicilian Admiral, George of Antioch, occupied Corfù, with the
connivance of the poorer inhabitants, who complained of the heavy
taxation of the Imperial Government which in the twelfth century
levied from that one Ionian Island about 9,000,000 <i>dr.</i> of modern
money, or more than the present Greek Exchequer raises from all the
seven, but was repulsed by the bold inhabitants of the impregnable
rock of Monemvasia; then, after plundering the west coast, he landed
his troops at the modern Itea, on the north of the Gulf of Corinth,
and thence marched past Delphi on Thebes, at that time the seat of
the silk manufacture. The city was undefended, but that did not save
it from the rapacity of the Normans. Alexander the Great had, at
least, spared “the house of Pindaros” when he took Thebes; but its
new conquerors left nothing that was of any value behind them. After
they had thoroughly ransacked the houses and churches they made
the Thebans swear on the Holy Scriptures that they had concealed
nothing, and then departed, dragging with them the most skilful
weavers and dyers so as to transfer the silk industry to Sicily. This
last was a serious blow to the monopoly of the silk trade which Greece
had hitherto enjoyed so far as Christian States were concerned. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
secret of the manufacture had been jealously guarded; and the fishers
who obtained the famous purple dye for the manufacturers were a
privileged class, exempted from the payment of military taxes. Roger
was well aware of the value of his captives; he established them and
their families at Palermo, and at the conclusion of the war they were
not restored to their homes in Greece. But the art of making and dyeing
silk does not seem to have died out at Thebes, which, fifteen years
after the Norman invasion, had recovered much of its former prosperity.
When the Jewish traveller, Benjamin of Tudela, visited it about 1161,
he found 2000 of his co-religionists there, among them the best weavers
and dyers in Greece, and towards the end of the century forty garments
of Theban silk were sent as a present by the Emperor to the Sultan
of Iconium. Although there are no silks now manufactured at Thebes
and no mulberry-trees there, the plain near the town is still called by
the peasants <i>Morokampos</i>, from the mulberry-trees which once grew
upon it. From Thebes the Normans proceeded to the rich city of
Corinth, which fell into their hands without a blow. Those who have
ascended the grand natural fortress of Akrocorinth may easily understand
the surprise of the warlike Normans at its surrender by the
cowardly Byzantine commandant. “If Nikephoros Chalouphes”—such
was his name—“had not been more timid than a woman,” exclaimed
the Sicilian admiral, “we should never have entered these walls.” The
town below yielded an even richer booty than Thebes—for it was then,
as under the Romans, the great emporium of the Levantine trade in
Greece—and laden with the spoils of Thebes and Corinth and with the
relics of St Theodore, the Norman fleet set sail on its homeward voyage.
Nineteen vessels fell victims to privateers, but the surviving ships
brought such a valuable cargo into the great harbour of Palermo that
the admiral was able to build out of his share the bridge which is still
called after him, Ponte dell’ Ammiraglio. The Church of La Martorana
as its older name of Sta Maria dell’ Ammiraglio testifies, was also founded
by him. The captives, except the silk-weavers, were afterwards restored
to their homes, and Corfù was recaptured by the chivalrous Emperor,
Manuel Comnenos, after a siege, in the course of which he performed
such prodigies of valour as to win the admiration of the Norman
commander.</p>

<p>The revival of material prosperity in Greece after the close of this
conflict was most remarkable, and in the second half of the twelfth
century that country must have been one of the most flourishing
parts of the Empire. The Arabian geographer, Edrisi, who wrote in
1153, tells us that the Peloponnese had thirteen cities, and alludes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
to the vegetation of Corfù, the size of Athens, and the fertility of the
great Thessalian plain, while Halmyros was then one of the most
important marts of the Empire. Benjamin of Tudela tells us of Jewish
communities in Larissa, Naupaktos, Arta, Corinth, Patras, Eubœa,
Corfù (consisting of one man), Zante, and Ægina, as well as in Thebes,
and this implies considerable wealth. Like St Nikon, he found them
in Sparta, and we may note as a curious phenomenon the existence
of a colony of Jewish agriculturists on the slopes of Parnassos. Salonika,
where the Hebrew element is now so conspicuous, even then had 500
Jews. When we remember how rare are Jews in Greece to-day, except
there and at Corfù, their presence in such numbers in the twelfth
century is all the more strange. Nor were they all engaged in money-making.
The worthy rabbi met Jews at Thebes who were learned in
the Talmud, while the Greek clergy had also some literary representatives.
It was about this time that the biography of St Nikon was
composed; the philosophical and theological writings of Nicholas,
Bishop of Methone, and Gregory, the Metropolitan of Corinth, belonged
to the same epoch. Athens, after a long eclipse, had once more become
a place of study. Yet, in point of wealth, Athens was inferior to several
other Greek cities, and perhaps for that reason had no Jewish colony.
We have from the pen of Michael Akominatos, the last Greek Metropolitan
of Athens before the Latin conquest, who was appointed about
1175, a full if somewhat pessimistic account of the condition of his
diocese, which then included ten bishoprics. Michael was a man of
distinguished family, a brother of the Byzantine statesman and historian,
Niketas Choniates, and a pupil of the great Homeric scholar, Eustathios,
who was Archbishop of Salonika. An ardent classical scholar, he had
been enchanted at the prospect of taking up his abode in the episcopal
residence on the Akropolis, of which he had formed the most glorified
idea. But the golden dream of the learned divine vanished at the touch
of reality. It was said of the Philhellenes, who went to aid the Greeks
in the War of Independence, that they expected to find the Peloponnese
filled with “Plutarch’s men”; finding that the modern Greeks were
not ancient heroes and sages, they at once put them down as scoundrels
and cut-throats. The worthy Michael seems to have experienced the
same disillusionment and to have committed the same error as the
Philhellenes. Fallen walls and rickety houses fringing mean streets
gave him a bad impression as he entered the city in triumphal procession.
His cathedral, it is true, with its frescoes and its offerings from
the time of Basil the Bulgar-slayer, with its eternal lamp, the wonder
of every pilgrim, and with the noble memories of the golden age of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Perikles which clung round its venerable structure, seemed to him
superior to Sta Sophia in all its glory, a palace worthy of a king. And
what bishop could boast of a minster such as the Parthenon? But the
Athenians, “the off-spring of true-born Athenians,” as he styled them
in his pompous inaugural address, did not appreciate, could scarcely
even understand, the academic graces of his style. The shallow soil
of Attica had become a parched desert, where little or no water was;
the classic fountain of Kallirrhoe had ceased to run, the olive-yards
were withered up by the drought. The silk-weavers and dyers, traces
of whose work have been found in the Odeion of Herodes Atticus, had
disappeared. Emigration and the exactions of the Byzantine officials
completed the tale of woe, which Michael was ever ready to pour into
the ear of a sympathetic correspondent. In 1198, he addressed a
memorial to the Emperor Alexios Comnenos III, on behalf of the
Athenians, from which we learn that the city was free from the jurisdiction
of the provincial governor, who resided at Thebes, and who
was not even allowed to enter the city, which, like Patras and Monemvasia,
was governed by its own <i>archontes</i>. But it appears that the
governor none the less quartered himself on the inhabitants, and had
thrice imposed higher ship-money on Athens than on Thebes and
Chalkis. Nor did the Metropolitan hesitate to tell another Emperor,
Isaac Angelos, that Athens was too poor to present him with the
usual coronation offering of a golden wreath. Yet, when the Lord High
Admiral came to Athens, he found merchantmen in the Piræus, and
the Government raised more out of the impoverished inhabitants than
out of Thebes and Eubœa. We must therefore not take too literally
all the rhetorical complaints of the archbishop, which are incompatible
with the great luxury of the Athenian Court under the French Dukes
in the next century. As a good friend of Athens, he was anxious to make
the city appear as poor as possible in the eyes of a grasping Government,
for in the East it has always been a dangerous thing to appear rich.
As a cultured man of the world, he exaggerated the “barbarism”—such
is his own phrase, which would have staggered the ancient Athenians—of
the spot where his lot had been cast. He derided the Attic Greek
of his time as a rude dialect, and told his classical friends that few
of the historic landmarks in Attica had preserved their ancient names
pure and undefiled. Sheep grazed, he said, among the remains of the
Painted Porch. “I live in Athens,” he wrote in a poem on the decay
of the city, “yet it is not Athens that I see.” Yet Athens was at least
spared the horrors of the sack of Salonika by the Normans of Sicily,
whose great invasion in 1185 touched only the fringe of Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>Then, as in the war which broke out between Venice and the
Empire some years earlier, it was the islands which suffered. After the
attack by the mob on the Latin quarter of Constantinople, those
Latins who escaped revenged themselves by preying upon the dwellers
in the Ægean, whose flourishing state had been noted by Edrisi before
that terrible visitation. Cephalonia and Zante were now permanently
severed from the Byzantine sway, many Italians settled there, and
after succumbing to Margaritone, the Sicilian admiral, Corfù, then a
very rich island, became for some years the home of Vetrano, a Latin
pirate, who was soon the terror of the Greek coasts. As if this were not
enough, Isaac Angelos robbed many of the churches of their ornaments
and pictures for the benefit of his capital, such as the famous picture
at Monemvasia of Our Lord being dragged to the Cross, and extortion
once more roused an insurrection in the Theme of Nikopolis. His
successor injured Greek trade by granting most extensive privileges
to the Venetians, who secured the commercial supremacy in the
Levant. The Byzantine State was becoming visibly weaker every day,
and the re-establishment of the second Bulgarian Empire suggested
to a bold official, Manuel Kamytzes, the idea of carving out, with
Bulgarian aid, a kingdom for himself in Greece. His attempt failed,
but the growth of feudalism had loosened the old ties which bound
that country to Constantinople. The power of the landed aristocracy,
the <i>archontes</i>, as they were called, had gone on growing since the days
of Danielis of Patras. Their rivalries threatened the Greek towns with
the scenes which disgraced the cities of mediæval Italy, and some of
them, like the great clan of Sgouros at Nauplia, were hereditary nobles
of almost princely position. Large estates, the curse of ancient Italy,
had grown up in Greece; the Empress Euphrosyne, for example, was
owner of a vast property in Thessaly, which included several flourishing
towns. Moreover, that province was no longer inhabited by a mainly
Greek population; in the twelfth century it had passed so completely
under Wallachian influence that it was known as Great Wallachia,
and its colonists were the ancestors of those Koutso-Wallachs, who
still pasture their herds in the country near the Thessalian frontier,
descending to Bœotia in the winter, and who, in the war of 1897,
were on the Turkish side. Finally a debased currency pointed to the
financial decline of the Byzantine Government. In short, the Empire
was ripe for the Latin conquest. It was not long delayed.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="heading1">1. THE FRANKISH CONQUEST OF GREECE</h3>

<p>Professor Krumbacher says in his <i>History of Byzantine
Literature</i>, that, when he announced his intention of devoting
himself to that subject, one of his classical friends solemnly remonstrated
with him, on the ground that there could be nothing of interest
in a period when the Greek preposition ἀπό governed the accusative,
instead of the genitive case. I am afraid that many people are of the
opinion of that orthodox grammarian. There has long prevailed in
some quarters an idea that, from the time of the Roman conquest in
146 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to the day when Archbishop Germanos raised the standard
of Independence at Kalavryta in 1821, the annals of Greece were
practically a blank, and that that country thus enjoyed for nearly
twenty centuries that form of happiness which consists in having no
history. Fifty years ago there was, perhaps, some excuse for this
theory; but the case is very different now. The great cemeteries of
Mediæval Greece—I mean the Archives of Venice, Naples, Palermo
and Barcelona—have given up their dead. We know now, year by
year, yes, almost month by month, the vicissitudes of Hellas under
her Frankish masters, and all that is required now is to breathe life
into the dry bones, and bring upon the stage in flesh and blood that
picturesque and motley crowd of Burgundian, Flemish and Lombard
nobles, German knights, rough soldiers of fortune from Cataluña and
Navarre, Florentine financiers, Neapolitan courtiers, shrewd Venetian
and Genoese merchant princes, and last, but not least, the bevy of
high-born dames, sprung from the oldest families of France, who make
up, together with the Greek <i>archons</i> and the Greek serfs, the persons
of the romantic drama, of which Greece was the theatre for 250 years.</p>

<p>The history of Frankish Greece begins with the Fourth Crusade.
I need not recapitulate the oft-told story of that memorable expedition,
which influenced for centuries the annals of Eastern Europe, and which
forms the historical basis of the Eastern question. We all know, from
the paintings of the Doge’s Palace, how the Crusaders set out with the
laudable object of freeing the Holy Sepulchre from the Infidel, how they
turned aside to the easier and more lucrative task of overturning the
oldest Empire in the world, and how they placed on the throne of all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Cæsars Count Baldwin of Flanders as first Latin Emperor of Constantinople.
The Greeks fled to Asia Minor, and there at Nice, the city of
the famous Council, and at Trebizond on the shores of the Black Sea,
founded two Empires, of which the latter existed for over 250 years.</p>

<p>When the Crusaders and their Venetian allies sat down to partition
the Byzantine Empire among themselves, they paid no heed to the
rights of nationalities or to the wishes of the people whose fate hung
upon their decisions. A fourth part of the Byzantine dominions, consisting
of the capital, the adjacent districts of Europe and Asia, and
several of the islands, was first set aside to form the new Latin Empire
of Romania. The remaining three-fourths were then divided in equal
shares between the Venetian Republic and the Crusaders, whose leader
was Boniface of Montferrat in the North of Italy, the rival of Baldwin
for the throne of the East. The Greek provinces in Asia, and the island
of Crete had originally been intended as his share of the spoil; but he
wished to obtain a compact extent of territory nearer his own home
and his wife’s native land of Hungary, and accordingly sold Crete to
the Venetians, and established himself as King of Salonika with
sovereignty over a large part of Greece, as yet unconquered. The
Venetians, with their shrewd commercial instincts and their much more
intimate knowledge of the country, secured all the best harbours, islands
and markets in the Levant—an incident which shows that an acquaintance
with geography may sometimes be useful to politicians.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1204 Boniface set out to conquer his Greek
dominions. The King of Salonika belonged to a family, which was no
stranger to the ways of the Orient. One of his brothers had married
the daughter of the Greek Emperor Manuel I; another brother and a
nephew were Kings of Jerusalem—a vain dignity which has descended
from them, together with the Marquisate of Montferrat, to the present
Italian dynasty. Married to the affable widow of the Greek Emperor
Isaac II, Boniface was a sympathetic figure to the Greeks, who had
speedily flocked in numbers to his side, and several of whom accompanied
him on his march through Greece. Among these was the bastard
Michael Angelos, of whom we shall hear later as the founder of a new
dynasty. With the King of Salonika there went too a motley crowd
of Crusaders in quest of fiefs, men of many nationalities, Lombards,
Flemings, Frenchmen and Germans. There were Guillaume de
Champlitte, a grandson of the Count of Champagne; Othon de la Roche,
son of a Burgundian noble; Jacques d’Avesnes, son of a Flemish
crusader who had been at the siege of Acre, and his two nephews,
Jacques and Nicholas de St Omer; Berthold von Katzenellenbogen, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Rhenish warrior who had given the signal for setting fire to Constantinople;
the Marquess Guido Pallavicini, youngest son of a nobleman
from near Parma, who had gone to Greece because at home every
common man could hale him before the courts; Thomas de Stromoncourt,
and Ravano dalle Carceri of Verona, brother of the <i>podestà</i>
Realdo, whose name still figures on the <i>Casa dei Mercanti</i> there. Just
as the modern general takes with him a band of war-correspondents
to chronicle his achievements, so Boniface was accompanied by Rambaud
de Vaqueiras, a troubadour from Provence, who afterwards
boasted in one of the letters in verse which he addressed to his patron,
that he “had helped him to conquer the Empire of the East and the
Kingdom of Salonika, the island of Pelops and the Duchy of Athens.”
Such were the men at whose head the Marquess of Montferrat marched
through the classic vale of Tempe, the route of so many armies, into
the great fertile plain of Thessaly.</p>

<p>While the Crusaders are traversing the vale of Tempe, let us ask
ourselves for a moment, who were the races, and what was the condition,
of the country which they were about to enter? The question is
important, for the answer to it will enable us to understand the ease
with which a small body of Franks conquered, almost without opposition,
nearly the whole of Greece. The bulk of the inhabitants were,
of course, Greeks; for no one, except a few propagandists, now believes
the theory, so confidently advanced by Professor Fallmerayer 90 years
ago, according to which there is not a single drop of Hellenic blood
in the Greek nation, but the Kingdom of Greece is inhabited by Slavs
and Albanians. At the time of the Frankish conquest, the Slavonic
elements in the population, the survivals of the Slavonic immigrations
of the dark centuries, were confined to the mountain fastnesses of
Arcadia and Laconia, where Taygetos was known as “the mountain
of the Slavs.” The marvellous power of the Hellenic race for absorbing
and hellenising foreign nationalities—a power like that of the Americans
in our own day—had prevented the Peloponnese from becoming a
Slav state, a Southern Serbia or Bulgaria, though such Slavonic names
as Charvati near Mycenæ and Slavochorio still preserve the memory
of the Slavonic settlements. As for the Albanians, they had not yet
entered Greece; had they done so, the conquest would probably have
been far less easy. Besides the Greeks and the Slavs, there were
Wallachs in Thessaly, who extended as far south as Lamia, and who
had bestowed upon the whole of that region the name, which we find
employed by the Byzantine historian Niketas, of “Great Wallachia.”
That the Wallachs are of Roman descent, scarcely admits of doubt;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
at the present day the Roumanians claim them as their kinsmen; and
the “Koutso”—or “lame,” Wallachs, so-called because they cannot
pronounce <i>chinch</i> (or <i>cinque</i>) correctly, form one of the most thorny
questions of contemporary diplomacy. The Jewish traveller, Benjamin
of Tudela, who visited Greece about 40 years before the Frankish
conquest, argued from their Scriptural names and from the fact that
they called the Jews “brethren,” that they were connected with his own
race. They showed, however, their “brotherly” love by merely robbing
the Israelites, while they both robbed and murdered the Greeks.</p>

<p>In the south-east of the Peloponnese were to be found the mysterious
Tzakones, a race which now exists at Leonidi and the adjacent villages
alone, but which then occupied a wider area. Opinions differ as to the
origin of this tribe, which still retains a dialect quite distinct from that
spoken anywhere else in Greek lands and which was noticed as a
“barbarian” tongue by the Byzantine satirist, Mazaris, in the fifteenth
century. But Dr Deffner of Athens, the greatest living authority on
their language, of which he has written a grammar, regards them as
the descendants of the ancient Laconians, their name as a corruption
of the words Τοὺς Λάκωνας, and their speech as “new Doric.” Scattered
about, wherever money was to be made by trade, were colonies of Jews.</p>

<p>The rule of the Franks must have seemed to many Greeks a welcome
relief from the financial oppression of the Byzantine Government.
Greece was, at the date of the Conquest, afflicted by three terrible
plagues: the tax collectors, the pirates, and the native tyrants. The
Imperial Government did nothing for the provinces, but wasted the
money which should have been spent on the defences of Greece, in
extravagant ostentation at the capital. Byzantine officials, sent to
Greece, regarded that classic land, in the phrase of Niketas, as an
“utter hole,” an uncomfortable place of exile. The two Greek provinces
were governed by one of these authorities, styled <i>prætor</i>, <i>protoprætor</i>,
or “general,” whose headquarters were at Thebes. We have from the
pen of Michael Akominatos, the last Metropolitan of Athens before
the conquest and brother of the historian Niketas, a vivid account of
the exactions of these personages. Theoretically, the city of Athens
was a privileged community. A golden bull of the Emperor forbade
the <i>prætor</i> to enter it with an armed force, so that the Athenians might
be spared the annoyance and expense of having soldiers quartered
upon them. Its regular contribution to the Imperial Exchequer was
limited to a land-tax, and it was expected to send a golden wreath as
a coronation offering to a new Emperor. But, in practice, these
privileges were apt to be ignored. The indignant Metropolitan complains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
that the <i>prætor</i>, under the pretext of worshipping in the Church of
“Our Lady of Athens,” as the Parthenon was then called, visited the
city with a large retinue. He laments that one of these Imperial
Governors had treated the city “more barbarously than Xerxes,” and
that the leaves of the trees, nay almost every hair on the heads of the
unfortunate Athenians, had been numbered. The authority of the
<i>prætor</i>, he says, is like Medea in the legend; just as she scattered her
poisons over Thessaly, so it scatters injustice over Greece—a classical
simile, which had its justification in the hard fact, that it had long been
the custom of the Byzantine Empire to pay the Governors of the
European provinces no salaries, but to make their office self-supporting,
a practice still followed by the Turkish Government. The Byzantine
Government, too, following a policy similar to that which cost our
King Charles I his throne, levied ship-money, really for the purpose
of its own coffers, nominally for the suppression of piracy.</p>

<p>Piracy was then, as so often, the curse of the islands and the deeply
indented coast of Greece. We learn from the English Chronicle ascribed
to Benedict of Peterborough, which gives a graphic account of Greece
as it was in 1191, that many of the islands were uninhabited from fear
of pirates, and that others were their chosen lairs. Cephalonia and
Ithake, which now appears under its mediæval name of Val di Compare—first
used, so far as I know by the Genoese historian, Caffaro, in the
first half of the twelfth century—had a specially evil reputation, and
bold was the sailor who dared venture through the channel between
them. Near Athens, the island of Ægina was a stronghold of corsairs,
who injured the property of the Athenian Church, and dangerously
wounded the nephew of the Metropolitan. Yet the remedy for piracy
was almost worse than the disease. Well might the anxious Metropolitan
tell the Lord High Admiral, that the Athenians regarded their proximity
to the sea as the greatest of their misfortunes.</p>

<p>Besides the Byzantine officials and the pirates, the Greeks had a
third set of tormentors in the shape of a brood of native tyrants, whose
feuds divided city against city and divided communities into rival
parties. Even where the Emperor had been nominally sovereign, the
real power was in the hands of local magnates, who had revived, on
the eve of the Frankish conquest, the petty tyrannies of ancient Greece.
Under the dynasty of the Comneni, who imitated and introduced the
ways of Western chivalry, feudalism had already made considerable
inroads into the East. At the time of the Fourth Crusade, local families
were in possession of large tracts of territory which they governed
almost like independent princes. Of all these <i>archontes</i>, as they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
called, the most powerful was Leon Sgouros, hereditary lord of Nauplia,
who had extended his sway over Argos “of the goodly steeds,” and had
seized the city and fortress of Corinth, proudly styling himself by a
high-sounding Byzantine title, and placing his fortunes under the
protection of St Theodore the Warrior. The manners of these local
magnates were no less savage than those of the Western barons of the
same period. Thus, Sgouros on one occasion invited the Archbishop
of Corinth to dinner, and then put out the eyes of his guest, and hurled
him over the rocks of the citadel. The contemporary historian Niketas
has painted in the darkest colours the character of the Greek <i>archontes</i>,
upon whom he lays the chief responsibility for the evils which befell
their country. He speaks of them as “inflamed by ambition against
their own fatherland, slavish men, spoiled by luxury, who made themselves
tyrants, instead of fighting the Latins.” The Emperor and
historian, John Cantacuzene, gives much the same description of their
descendants a century and a half later.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of Greece, when Boniface and his army
emerged from the vale of Tempe and marched across the plain of
Thessaly to Larissa. He bestowed that ancient city upon a Lombard
noble, who henceforth styled himself Guglielmo de Larsa from the
name of his fief. Velestino, the ancient Pheræ, the scene of the legend
of Admetos and Alcestis, and the site of the modern battle, fell to the
share of Berthold von Katzenellenbogen, whose name must have proved
a stumbling-block to his Thessalian vassals. The army then took the
usual route by way of Pharsala and Domoko—names familiar alike
in the ancient and modern history of Greek warfare—down to Lamia
and thence across the Trachinian plain to Thermopylæ, where Sgouros
was awaiting it. But the memories of Leonidas failed to inspire the
<i>archon</i> of Nauplia to follow his example. Niketas tells us that the mere
sight of the Latin knights in their coats of mail sufficed to make him
flee straight to his own fastness of Akrocorinth, leaving the pass undefended.
Conscious of its strength—for Thermopylæ must have been
far more of a defile then than now—Boniface resolved to secure it
permanently against attack. He therefore invested the Marquess Guido
Pallavicini, nicknamed by the Greeks “Marchesopoulo,” with the fief
of Boudonitza, which commanded the other end of the pass. Thus
arose the famous Marquisate of Boudonitza, which was destined to
play an important part in the Frankish history of Greece, and which,
after a continuous existence of over two centuries, as guardian of the
Northern marches, has left a memory of its fallen greatness in the ruins
of the castle and chapel of its former lords, of whose descendants, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Zorzi of Venice, there are still living—so Mr Horatio Brown informs
me—some thirty representatives in that city. Following the present
carriage-road from Lamia to the Corinthian Gulf, Boniface established
another defensive post at the pass of Gravia, so famous centuries afterwards
in the War of Independence, conferring it as a fief on the two
brothers Jacques and Nicholas de St Omer. At the foot of Parnassos,
on the site of the ancient Amphissa, he next founded the celebrated
barony of Salona, which lasted almost as long as the Marquisate of
Boudonitza. Upon the almost Cyclopean stones of the classic Akropolis
of Amphissa, which Philip of Macedon had destroyed fifteen centuries
before, Thomas de Stromoncourt built himself the fortress, of which
the majestic ruins—perhaps the finest Frankish remains in Greece—still
stand among the cornfields on the hill above the modern town.
According to the local tradition, the name of Salona, which the place
still bears in common parlance, despite the usual official efforts to revive
the classical terminology, is derived from the King of Salonika, its
second founder. The lord of Salona soon extended his sway down to
the harbour of Galaxidi, and the barony became so important that two
at least of the house of Stromoncourt struck coins of their own, which
are still preserved.</p>

<p>Boniface next marched into Bœotia, where the people, glad to be
relieved from the oppression of Sgouros, at once submitted. Thebes
joyfully opened her gates, and then the invaders pursued their way to
Athens. The Metropolitan thought it useless to defend the city, and a
Frankish guard was soon stationed on the Akropolis. The Crusaders
had no respect for the great Cathedral. To these soldiers of fortune the
classic glories of the Parthenon appealed as little as the sanctity of the
Orthodox Church. The rich treasury of the Cathedral was plundered,
the holy vessels were melted down, the library which the Metropolitan
had collected was dispersed. Unable to bear the sight, Akominatos
quitted the scene where he had laboured so long, and, after wandering
about for a time, finally settled down in the island of Keos, whence he
could at least see the coast of Attica.</p>

<p>Thebes with Bœotia and Athens with Attica and the Megarid were
bestowed by the King of Salonika upon his trusty comrade in arms, Othon
de la Roche, who had rendered him a valuable service by assisting to
settle a serious dispute between him and the Emperor Baldwin, and
who afterwards negotiated the marriage between Boniface’s daughter
and Baldwin’s brother and successor. Thus, in the words of a monkish
chronicler, “Othon de la Roche, son of a certain Burgundian noble,
became, as by a miracle, Duke of the Athenians and Thebans.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
chronicler was only wrong in the title which he attributed to the lucky
Frenchman, who had thus succeeded to the glories of the heroes and
sages of Athens. Othon modestly styled himself <i>Sire d’Athènes</i>, or
<i>Dominus Athenarum</i> in official documents, which his Greek subjects
magnified into “the Great Lord” (Μέγας κύρ), and Dante, who had
probably heard that such had been the title of the first Frankish ruler
of Athens, transferred it by a poetic anachronism to Peisistratos. Half
a century after the conquest, Othon’s nephew and successor, Guy I,
received, at his request, the title of Duke from Louis IX of France—and
Shakespeare in <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> and Chaucer in <i>The Knight’s
Tale</i> have by a similar anachronism conferred the ducal title of the De
la Roche upon Theseus, the legendary founder of Athens. Contemporary
accounts make no mention of any resistance to the Lord of Athens on
the part of the Greeks. Later Venetian authors, however, actuated
perhaps by patriotic bias, propagated a story, that the Athenians sent
an embassy to offer their city to Venice, but that their scheme was
frustrated “not without bloodshed by the men of Champagne under
the Lord de la Roche.”</p>

<p>We naturally ask ourselves what was the appearance and condition
of the most famous city of the ancient world at the time of Othon’s
accession, and the voluminous writings of the eminent man who was
Metropolitan at that moment, which have been published by Professor
Lampros of Athens, throw a flood of light upon the Athens of the
beginning of the thirteenth century. The only Athenian manufactures
were soap and the weaving of monkish habits, but the ships of the
Piræus still took part in the purple-fishing off the lonely island of
Gyaros, the Botany Bay of the Roman Empire. There was still some
trade at the Piræus, for the Byzantine Admiral had found vessels
there. It was then guarded by the huge lion, now in front of the
arsenal at Venice, which gave the harbour its mediæval name of Porto
Leone, and on which Harold Hardrada, afterwards slain at Stamford
Bridge, had scratched his name nearly two centuries before. We may
infer, too, from the mention of Athens in the commercial treaties
between Venice and the Byzantine Empire that the astute Republicans
saw some prospect of making money there. But the “thin soil” of Attica
was as unproductive as in the days of Thucydides, and yielded nothing
but oil, honey, and wine, the last strongly flavoured with resin, as it
still is, so that the Metropolitan could write to a friend that it “seems
to be pressed from the juice of the pine rather than from that of the
grape.” The harvest was always meagre, and famines were common.
Even ordinary necessaries were not always obtainable. Akominatos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
could not find a decent carriage-builder in the place; and, in his despair
at the absence of blacksmiths and workers in iron, he was constrained
to apply to Athens the words of Jeremiah: “the bellows are burnt.”
Emigration, still the curse of Greece, was draining off the able-bodied
poor, so that the population had greatly diminished, and the city
threatened to become what Aristophanes had called “a Scythian
wilderness.”</p>

<p>Externally, the visitor to the Athens of that day, must have been
struck by the marked contrast between the splendid monuments of
the classic age and the squalid surroundings of the mediæval town.
The walls were lying in ruins, the houses of the emigrants had been
pulled down, the streets, where once the sages of antiquity had walked,
were now desolate. But the hand of the invader and the tooth of time
had, on the whole, dealt gently with the Athenian monuments. The
Parthenon, converted long before into the Cathedral of Our Lady of
Athens, was almost as little damaged, as if it had only just been built.
The metopes, the pediments, and the frieze were still intact, and
remained so when, more than two centuries later, Cyriacus of Ancona,
the first archæologist who had ever visited Athens during the Frankish
period, drew his sketch of the Parthenon, which is still preserved in
Berlin and of which a copy by Sangallo may be seen in the Vatican
library. On the walls were the frescoes, traces of which are still visible,
executed by order of the Emperor Basil II, “the slayer of the Bulgarians,”
nearly two centuries earlier. Over the altar was a golden
dove, representing the Holy Ghost, and ever flying with perpetual
motion. In the cathedral, too, was an ever-burning lamp, fed by oil
that never failed, which was the marvel of the pilgrims. So widespread
was the fame of the Athenian Minster, that the great folk of
Constantinople, in spite of their supercilious contempt for the provinces
and their dislike of travel, came to do obeisance there. Of the other
ancient buildings on the sacred rock, the graceful temple of Nike Apteros
had been turned into a chapel; the Erechtheion had become a church
of the Saviour, or a chapel of the Virgin, while the episcopal residence,
which is known to have then been on the Akropolis, was probably in
the Propylæa. The whole Akropolis had for centuries been made into a
fortress, the only defence which Athens then possessed, strong enough
to have resisted the attack of a Greek magnate like Sgouros, but
incapable of repulsing a Latin army. Already strange legends and
new names had begun to grow round some of the classical monuments.
The Choragic monument of Lysikrates was already popularly known
as “the lantern of Demosthenes,” its usual designation during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Turkish domination, when it became the Capuchin Convent, serving
in 1811 as a study to Lord Byron, who from within its walls launched
his bitter poem against the filcher of the Elgin marbles. But, even at
the beginning of the thirteenth century, many of the ancient names
of places lingered in the mouths of the people. The classically cultured
Metropolitan was gratified as a good Philhellene, to hear that the
Piræus and Hymettos, Eleusis and Marathon, the Areopagos and
Kallirrhoe, Salamis and Ægina were still called by names, which the
contemporaries of Perikles had used, even though the Areopagos was
nothing but a bare rock, the plain of Marathon yielded no corn, and
the “beautifully-flowing” fountain had ceased to flow. But new,
uncouth names were beginning to creep in; thus, the partition treaty
of 1204 describes Salamis as “Culuris” (or, “the lizard”), a vulgar
name, derived from the shape of the island, which I have heard used
in Attica at the present day.</p>

<p>Of the intellectual condition of Athens we should form but a low
estimate, if we judged entirely from the lamentations of the elegant
Byzantine scholar whom fate had made its Metropolitan. Akominatos
had found that his tropes, and fine periods, and classical allusions were
far over the heads of the Athenians who came to hear him, and who
talked in his cathedral, even though that cathedral was the Parthenon.
He wrote that his long residence in Greece had made him a barbarian.
Yet he was able to add to his store of manuscripts in this small provincial
town. Moreover, there is some evidence to prove that, even at this
period, Athens was a place of study, whither Georgians from the East
and English from the West came to obtain a liberal education. Matthew
Paris tells us of Master John of Basingstoke, Archdeacon of Leicester
in the reign of Henry III, who used often to say, that whatever scientific
knowledge he possessed had been acquired from the youthful daughter
of the Archbishop of Athens. This young lady could forecast the advent
of pestilences, thunderstorms, eclipses, and earthquakes. From learned
Greeks at Athens Master John professed to have heard some things of
which the Latins had no knowledge; he found there the testaments
of the twelve Patriarchs, and he brought back to England the Greek
numerals and many books, including a Greek grammar which had been
compiled for him at Athens. The same author tells us, too, of “certain
Greek philosophers”—that is, in mediæval Greek parlance, monks—who
came from Athens at this very time to the Court of King John,
and disputed about nice sharp quillets of theology with English divines.
It is stated, also, though on indifferent authority, as Mr F. C. Conybeare
of Oxford kindly informs me, that the Georgian poet, Chota Roustavéli,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
and other Georgians spent several years at Athens on the eve of the
Frankish conquest.</p>

<p>Othon de la Roche showed his gratitude to his benefactor, the King
of Salonika, by accompanying him in his attack upon the strongholds
of Sgouros in the Peloponnese. The Franks routed the Greek army
at the Isthmus of Corinth, and while Othon laid siege to the noble castle
above that town, Boniface proceeded to the attack on Nauplia. There
he was joined by a man, who was destined to be the conqueror and
ruler of the peninsula.</p>

<p>It chanced that, a little before the capture of Constantinople,
Geoffroy de Villehardouin, nephew of the quaint chronicler of the Fourth
Crusade, had set out on a pilgrimage to Palestine. On his arrival in
Syria, he heard of the great achievements of the Crusaders, and resolved
without loss of time to join them. But his ship was driven out of its
course by a violent storm, and Geoffroy was forced to take shelter in
the harbour of Methone on the coast of Messenia. During the winter
of 1204, which he spent at that spot, he received an invitation from a
local magnate to join him in an attack on the lands of the neighbouring
Greeks. Villehardouin, nothing loth, placed his sword at the disposal
of the Greek traitor, and success crowned the arms of these unnatural
allies. But the Greek <i>archon</i> died, and his son, more patriotic or more
prudent than his father, repudiated the dangerous alliance with the
Frankish stranger. But it was too late. Villehardouin had discovered
the fatal secret, that the Greeks of the Peloponnese were an unwarlike
race, whose land would fall an easy conquest to a resolute band of
Latins. At this moment, tidings reached him that Boniface was besieging
Nauplia. He at once set out on a six days’ journey across a
hostile country to seek his aid. In the camp he found his old friend
and fellow-countryman, Guillaume de Champlitte, who was willing to
assist him. He described to Champlitte the richness of the land which
men called “the Morea”—a term which now occurs for the first time
in history, and which seems to have been originally applied to the
coast of Elis and thence extended to the whole peninsula, just as the
name Italy, originally a part of Calabria, has similarly spread over the
whole of that country. He professed his readiness to recognise Champlitte
as his liege lord in return for his aid, and Boniface consented, after
some hesitation, to their undertaking. With a hundred knights and
some men-at-arms, the two friends rode out from the camp before
Nauplia to conquer the peninsula.</p>

<p>The conquest of the Morea has been compared with that of England
by the Normans. In both cases a single pitched battle decided the fate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of the country, but in the Morea, the conquerors did not, as in England,
amalgamate with the conquered. The Hastings of the Peloponnese was
fought in the olive-grove of Koundoura, in the North-East of Messenia,
and the little Frankish force of between 500 and 700 men easily routed
the over-confident Greeks, aided by the Slavs of Taygetos, who altogether
numbered from 4000 to 6000. After this, one place after another fell
into the hands of the Franks, who showed towards the conquered that
tact which we believe to be one of the chief causes of our own success
in dealing with subject races. Provided that their religion was respected,
the Greeks were not unwilling to accept the Franks as their masters,
and on this point the conquerors, who were not bigots, made no
difficulties. By the year 1212, the whole of the peninsula was Frankish,
except where the Greek flag still waved over the impregnable rock of
Monemvasia, the St Michael’s Mount of Greece, and where at the two
stations of Methone and Korone in Messenia Venice had raised the
lion-banner of St Mark. Insignificant as they are now, those twin
colonies were of great value to the Venetian traders, and there is a
whole literature about them in the Venetian Archives. All the galleys
stopped there on the way to Syria and Crete; pilgrims to the Holy
Land found a welcome there in “the German house,” founded by the
Teutonic Knights, and as late as 1532 there was a Christian Governor
at Korone. The population was then removed to Sicily, and of those
exiles the present Albanian monks of Grottaferrata are the descendants.</p>

<p>I have now described the conquest of the mainland; it remains to
speak of the islands, which had mostly been allotted to Venice by the
treaty of partition. But the shrewd Government saw that its resources
could not stand the strain of conquering and administering the large
group of the Cyclades. It was, therefore, decided to leave to private
citizens the task of occupying them. There was no lack of enterprise
among the Venetians of that day, and on the bench of the Consular
Court, as we should now call it, at Constantinople, sat the very man for
such an enterprise—Marco Sanudo, nephew of “the old Doge Dandolo.”
Sanudo descended from the bench, gathered round him a band of
adventurous spirits, equipped eight galleys and was soon master of
seventeen islands, some of which he distributed as fiefs to his comrades.
Naxos alone offered any real resistance, and, in 1207, the conqueror
founded the Duchy of “the Dodekannesos” (or “Twelve Islands,” as
the Byzantines called it), which soon received the title of the “Duchy
of Naxos,” or “of the Archipelago”—a corruption of the name “Ægeopelagos,”
which occurs as early as a Venetian document of 1268. This
delectable Duchy lasted, first under the Sanudi, and then under the Crispi,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
till 1566, while the Gozzadini of Bologna held seven of the islands down to
1617, and Tenos remained in Venetian hands till it was finally taken in
1715 and ceded to the Turks by the peace of Passarovitz in 1718. For
persons so important as the Dukes it was necessary to invent a truly
Roman genealogy; accordingly, the Paduan biographer, Zabarella, makes
the Sanudi descend from the historian Livy, while the Crispi, not to be
beaten, claimed Sallust as their ancestor, and may, perhaps, be regarded
as the forbears of the late Italian Prime Minister, Francesco Crispi.</p>

<p>The two great islands of Crete and Eubœa had very different
fortunes. Crete, as we saw, was sold by Boniface to the Venetians,
and remained a Venetian colony for nearly five centuries. Eubœa,
or Negroponte, as it was called in the Middle Ages, was divided by
Boniface into three large baronies, which were assigned to three
Lombard nobles from Verona, who styled themselves the <i>terciers</i>,
or <i>terzieri</i>. We have no English equivalent for the word; perhaps,
borrowing a hint from Shakespeare, we may call them “the three
Gentlemen of Verona.” But Venice soon established a colony, governed
by a bailie, at Chalkis, the capital of the island, and the subsequent
history of Negroponte shows the gradual extension of Venetian influence
over the Lombards.</p>

<p>The seven Ionian Islands naturally fall into three divisions. Kythera
(or Cerigo) in the far South; the centred group, consisting of Zante,
Cephalonia, Ithake, and Levkas (or Santa Maura); and Corfù and
Paxo in the North. Of these divisions, the first fell to the share of a
scion of the great Venetian family of Venier—a family which traced
its name and descent from Venus, and naturally claimed the island,
where she had risen from the sea. Zante, Cephalonia and Ithake had
a very curious history—a history long obscure, but now well ascertained.
They belonged to Count Maio (or Matteo) Orsini, a member of the
great Roman family, who came, as the Spanish Chronicle of the Morea
informs us, from Monopoli in Apulia. This bold adventurer, half-pirate,
half-crusader,—a not unusual combination in those days—thus succeeded
to the realm of Odysseus, which was thenceforth known, from
his title, as the County Palatine of Cephalonia. Corfù with its appendage
of Paxo, was at first assigned to ten nobles of the Republic in return
for an annual payment. But, ere long, those two islands, together
with Levkas, which is scarcely an island at all, were included in the
dominions of a Greek prince, the bastard Michael Angelos, who had
slipped away from the camp of Boniface, and had established himself,
by an opportune marriage with the widow of the late Byzantine
governor, as independent Greek sovereign of Epeiros. His wife was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
native of the country; his father had been its governor; he thus appealed
to the national feelings of the natives, whose mountainous country
has in all ages defied the attacks of invading armies. A man of great
vigour, he soon extended his sway from his capital of Arta to Durazzo
in the North, and to the Corinthian Gulf in the South, and his dominions,
known as the principality, or Despotat of Epeiros, served as the rallying
point of Hellenism—the only portion of Greece, except Monemvasia,
which still remained Greek.</p>

<p>I would fain have said something of the inner life of Frankish
Greece—of its society, of its literature, and of the great influence which
women exercised in its affairs. But for these subjects there is no time
left. I would only add, in conclusion, that the Frankish conquest of
Greece affords the clue to one of the vexed problems of modern literature—the
second part of Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>, which an American scholar,
Dr Schmitt, has shown to have been inspired by the account given in
the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i>, a work which was first printed by Buchon
in 1825, at the time when Goethe was engaged on that part of his
famous tragedy. Its origin is obvious from the following lines, which
he puts into the mouth of his hero:</p>

<h3 id="heading2">2. FRANKISH SOCIETY IN GREECE</h3>

<p>We saw in the last essay, how at the beginning of the thirteenth
century a small body of Franks conquered nearly the whole of Greece,
and how, as the result of their conquests, a group of Latin states sprang
into existence in that country—the Duchies of Athens and of the Archipelago,
the principality of Achaia, the County Palatine of Cephalonia,
the three baronies of Eubœa, and the Venetian colony of Crete, while
at two points alone—in the mountains of Epeiros and on the isolated
rock of Monemvasia, so well-known to our ancestors as the place whence
they obtained their Malmsey wine—the Greek flag still waved. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
present essay, I would give some account of Frankish organisation,
political and ecclesiastical, of Frankish society, and of Frankish literature.</p>

<p>The usual tendency of the desperately logical Latin intellect, when
brought face to face with a new set of political conditions, is to frame
a paper constitution, absolutely perfect in theory, and absolutely
unworkable in practice. But the French noblemen whom an extraordinary
accident had converted into Spartan and Athenian law-givers,
resisted this temptation, nor did they seek inspiration from the laws of
Solon and Lycurgus. They fortunately possessed a model, the <i>Assizes
of Jerusalem</i> which had been drawn up a century before for that Kingdom,
and which, under the name of the <i>Book of the Customs of the
Empire of Romania</i>—a work still preserved in a Venetian version of
1452 drawn up for the island of Eubœa—was applied to all the Frankish
states in Greece. This feudal constitution, barbarous as it may seem
to our modern ideas, seems to have worked well; at any rate, it was tried
by the best test, that of experience, and lasted, with one small amendment,
for 250 years. In Achaia, about which we have most information,
a commission was appointed, consisting of two Latin bishops, two
bannerets, and five leading Greeks, under the presidency of Geoffroy
de Villehardouin, for the purpose of dividing the Morea into fiefs and
of assigning these to the members of the conquering force according
to their wealth and the numbers of their followers, and the book, or
“register” as the Chronicler calls it, containing the report of this
commission, was then laid before a Parliament, held at Andravida, or
Andreville, in Elis, now a small village which the traveller passes in
the train between Patras and Olympia, but then the capital of the
principality of Achaia.</p>

<p>According to this Achaian Doomsday-book, twelve baronies, whose
number recalls the twelve peers of Charlemagne, were created, their
holders, with the other lieges, forming a High Court, which not only
advised the Prince in political matters but acted as a judicial tribunal
for the decision of feudal questions. In the creation of these twelve
baronies due regard was paid to the fact that the Franks were a military
colony in the midst of an alien, and possibly hostile, population, spread
over a country possessing remarkable strategic positions. Later on,
after the distribution of the baronies, strong castles were erected in
each upon some natural coign of vantage, from which the baron could
overawe the surrounding country. The main object of this system
may be seen from the name of the famous Arcadian fortress of Matagrifon,
a name given also to our Richard I’s castle at Messina<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, (“Kill-Greek,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the Greeks being usually called <i>Grifon</i> by the French
chroniclers), built near the modern Demetsana by the baron of Akova,
Gautier de Rozières, to protect the rich valley of the Alpheios. The
splendid remains of the castle of Karytaina, the Greek Toledo, which
dominates the gorge of that classic river, which the Franks called
<i>Charbon</i>, still mark the spot where Hugues de Bruyères and his son
Geoffroy built a stronghold out of the ruins of the Hellenic Brenthe
to terrify the Slavs of Skorta, the ancient Gortys and the home of the
late Greek Prime Minister, Delyannes. The special importance of these
two baronies was demonstrated by the bestowal of 24 knights’ fees
upon the former and of 22 upon the latter. The castle-crowned hill
of Passavâ, so-called, not, as Fallmerayer imagined, from a Slavonic
Passau, but from the French war-cry <i>Passe Avant</i>, still reminds us
how Jean de Neuilly, hereditary marshal of Achaia and holder of four
fiefs, once watched the restless men of Maina; and, if earthquakes
have left no mediæval buildings at Vostitza, the classic Aigion, where
Hugues de Lille de Charpigny received eight knights’ fees, his family
name still survives in the village of Kerpine, now a station on the
funicular railway between Diakophto and Kalavryta. At Kalavryta
itself Othon de Tournay, and at Chalandritza to the south of Patras
Audebert de la Trémouille, scion of a family famous in the history of
France, were established, with twelve and four fiefs respectively.
Veligosti near Megalopolis with four fell to the share of the Belgian
Matthieu de Valaincourt de Mons, and Nikli near Tegea with six to that
of Guillaume de Morlay. Guy de Nivelet kept the Tzakones of Leonidi
in check and watched the plain of Lakonia from his barony of Geraki
with its six fiefs—a castle which has been surveyed by the British School
at Athens—and Gritzena, entrusted to a baron named Luke with four
fiefs depending on it guarded the ravines of the mountainous region
round Kalamata. Patras became the barony of Guillaume Aleman, a
member of a Provençal family still existing at Corfù, and the bold
baron did not scruple to build his castle out of the house and church
of the Latin Archbishop. Finally, the dozen was completed by the
fiefs of Kalamata and Kyparissia (or Arkadia, as it was called in the
Middle Ages, when what we call Arcadia was known as Mesarea) which
became the barony of Geoffroy de Villehardouin. In addition to these
twelve temporal peers there were seven ecclesiastical barons, whose
sees were carved out on the lines of the existing Greek organisation,
and of whom Antelme of Clugny, Latin Archbishop of Patras and
Primate of Achaia was the chief. The Archbishop received eight
knights’ fees, the bishops four a piece, and the same number was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
assigned to each of the three great Military Orders of the Teutonic
Knights, the Knights of St John, and the Templars. When, a century
later, the Templars were dissolved, their possessions went to the Knights
of St John. In Elis was the domain of the Prince, and his usual residence,
when he was not at Andravida, was at Lacedæmonia, or La Crémonie,
as the Franks called it.</p>

<p>After the distribution of the baronies came the assignment of
military service. All vassals were liable to render four months’ service
in the field, and to spend four months in garrison (from which the
prelates and the three Military Orders were alone exempted), and
even during the remaining four months, which they could pass at
home, they were expected to hold themselves ready to obey the summons
of the Prince. After the age of 60, personal service was no longer
required; but the vassal must send his son, or, if he had no son, some
one else in his stead. Thus the Franks were on a constant war footing;
their whole organisation was military—a fact which explains the ease
with which they held down the unwarlike Greeks, so many times their
superiors in numbers. This military organisation had, however, as the
eminent modern Greek historian Paparregopoulos has pointed out, the
effect of making the Greeks, too, imbibe in course of time something of
the spirit of their conquerors. It is thus that we may explain the extraordinary
contrast between the tameness with which the Greeks accepted
the Frankish domination, and their frequent rebellions against that
of the Turks. All over the Levant and even in Italy the Frankish
chivalry of Achaia became famous. They fought against the luckless
Conradin at Tagliacozzo, and the ruse, which won that battle and which
Dante has ascribed to Erard de Valéry, is attributed by the <i>Chronicle
of the Morea</i> to Prince William of Achaia. Round the Prince there grew
up a hierarchy of great officials with high-sounding titles, to which
the Greeks had no difficulty in fitting Byzantine equivalents. The
Prince himself bore a sceptre, as the symbol of his office, when he
presided over the sessions of the High Court.</p>

<p>We learn from the <i>Book of the Customs of the Empire of Romania</i>
something about the way in which the feudal system worked in the
principality of Achaia. Society was there composed of six main
elements—the Prince, the holders of the twelve great baronies, the
greater and lesser vassals (among whom were some Greeks), the freemen,
and the serfs. The Prince and his twelve peers alone had the power of
inflicting capital punishment; but even the Prince could not punish
any of the barons without the consent of the greater vassals. If he
were taken prisoner in battle, he could call upon his vassals to become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
hostages in his place, until he had raised the amount of his ransom.
No one, except the twelve peers, was allowed to build a castle in
Achaia without his permission, and without it any vassal, who left
the country and stayed abroad, was liable to lose his fief. Leave of
absence was, however, never refused if the vassal wished to claim the
succession to a fief abroad, to contract a marriage, or to make a pilgrimage
to the Holy Sepulchre, or to the Churches of St Peter and St Paul in
Rome or to that of St James at Compostella. But in such cases the
vassals must return within two years and two days. The vassals were
of two classes, the greater (or <i>ligii</i>) and the lesser (or <i>homines plani
homagii</i>), who took no part in the Council of the Prince. A liege could
not sell his fief without the Prince’s consent; but if the liege were a
widow—for the Salic Law did not obtain in Frankish Greece, and ladies
often held important fiefs—she might marry whom she pleased, except
only an enemy of the Prince. When a fief fell vacant, the successor must
needs appear to advance his claim within a year and a day if he were
in Achaia, within two years and two days if he were abroad. It was
the tricky application of this rule which led to the succession of Geoffroy
de Villehardouin to the throne of Achaia. Champlitte had been summoned
away to claim a fief in France, and had requested his trusted
comrade in arms to act as his viceroy till he had sent a relative to take
his place. When the news reached the Morea that a young cousin of
Champlitte was on his way, Geoffroy resolved to use artifice in order
to prevent his arrival in time. He accordingly begged the Doge to
assist him, and the latter, who had excellent reasons for remaining on
good terms with him, managed to entertain his passing guest at Venice
for more than two months. When, at last, young Robert de Champlitte
put to sea, the ship’s captain received orders to leave him ashore at
Corfù, and it was with difficulty that he managed to obtain a passage
from there to the Morea. When he landed there he had, however, a
few days still in hand; but the crafty Villehardouin managed by
marching rapidly from one place to another to avoid meeting him till
the full term prescribed by the feudal pact had expired. He was then
informed that he had forfeited the principality, which thus fell to
Villehardouin by a legal quibble. The pious did not, however, forget
to point out later on, that the crime of the founder of the dynasty was
visited upon his family to the third and fourth generation, as we shall
see in the sequel.</p>

<p>There was a great difference between feudal society in Achaia and
in the Duchy of Athens. While in the principality the Prince was merely
<i>primus inter pares</i>, at Athens the “Great Lord” had at the most one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
exalted noble, the head of the great house of St Omer, near his throne.
It is obvious from the silence of all the authorities, that the Burgundians
who settled with Othon de la Roche in his Greek dominions were men of
inferior social position to himself—a fact further demonstrated by the
comparative lack in Attica and Bœotia of those baronial castles, so
common in the Morea. Indeed, it is probable that, in one respect, the
Court of Athens under the De la Roche resembled the Court of the late
King George, namely, that there was no one, except the members
of his own family, with whom the ruler could associate on equal terms.
But in Frankish, as in modern Athens, the family of the sovereign was
soon numerous enough to form a coterie of its own. The news of their
relative’s astounding fortune attracted to Attica several members of
his clan from their home in Burgundy; they doubtless received their
share of the good things, which had fallen to Othon; one nephew divided
with his uncle the lordship of Thebes, another more distant kinsman
became commander of the castle of Athens. Other Burgundians will
doubtless have followed in their wake, for in the thirteenth century
Greece, or “New France,” as Pope Honorius III called it, was to the
younger sons of French noble houses what the British colonies were
fifty years ago to impecunious but energetic Englishmen. The elder
Sanudo, who derived his information from his relatives, the Dukes
of Naxos, specially tells us that this was the case at the Achaian Court.
He says of Geoffroy II of Achaia, that “he possessed a broad domain
and great riches; he was wont to send his most confidential advisers
from time to time to the Courts of his vassals, to see how they lived,
and how they treated their subjects. At his own Court he constantly
maintained 80 knights with golden spurs, to whom he gave their pay
and all that they required; so knights came from France, from Burgundy,
and above all from Champagne. Some came to amuse themselves, others
to pay their debts; others because of crimes which they had committed
at home.”</p>

<p>There was another marked distinction between Attica and the
Morea. Niketas mentions no great local magnates as settled at Athens
or Thebes in the last days of the Byzantine domination, nor do we hear
of such during the whole century of Burgundian rule. Thus, whereas
Crete, Negroponte, and the Morea still retained old native families,
which in Crete headed insurrections, in Negroponte showed a tendency
to emigrate, and in the Morea held fiefs and even occasionally, as in
the case of the Sgouromallaioi, intermarried with the Franks, who
usually, as Muntaner tells us, took their wives from France and despised
marriages with Greeks even of high degree, Athens contained no such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
native aristocracy. It is only towards the close of the fourteenth
century that we hear of any Greeks prominent there, and then they
are not nobles, but notaries. Only in the last two generations of Latin
rule, is there a national party at Athens, in which the famous family
of Chalkokondyles, which produced the last Athenian historian, was
prominent. The Greeks of Attica were, therefore, mostly peasants,
whose lot was much the same as it was all over the feudal world, namely
that of serfdom. We have examples, too, of actual slavery at Athens,
even in the last decades of the Latin domination.</p>

<p>Othon’s dominions were large, if measured by the small standard of
classical Greece. Burgundian Athens embraced Attica, Bœotia, the
Megarid, the ancient Opuntian Lokris, and the fortresses of Nauplia
and Argos, which the “Great Lord” had received as a fief from the
principality of Achaia in return for his services at the time of their
capture. Thus situated, the Athenian state had a considerable coast-line
and at least four ports—the Piræus, Nauplia, the harbour of
Atalante opposite Eubœa, and Livadostro, or Rive d’Ostre, as the
Franks called it, on the Gulf of Corinth—the usual port of embarkation
for the West. Yet the Burgundian rulers of Athens made little attempt
to create a navy, confining themselves to a little amateur piracy.
Venice was most jealous of any other Latin state, which showed any
desire to rival her as a maritime power in the Levant, and in a treaty
concluded in 1319 between the Republic and the Catalans, who then
held the Duchy of Athens, it was expressly provided that they should
launch no new ships in “the sea of Athens” and should dismantle
those already afloat and place their tackle in the Akropolis.</p>

<p>We are not told where the first Frankish ruler of Athens resided, but
there can be no doubt that, like his immediate successors, he fixed his
capital at Thebes—for it was not till the time of the Florentine Dukes
in the fifteenth century that the Propylæa at Athens became the
ducal palace. The old Bœotian city continued, under the Burgundian
dynasty, to be the most important place in the Athenian Duchy. The
silk manufacture still continued there; for it is specially mentioned in
the commercial treaty which Guy I of Athens concluded with the
Genoese in 1240, and we hear of a gift of 20 silken garments from Guy II
to Pope Boniface VIII. The town contained both a Genoese and a
Jewish colony, and it was a nest of Hebrew poets, whose verses, if we
may believe a rival bard, were one mass of barbarisms. But the great
feature of Thebes was the castle, built by Nicholas II de St Omer out
of the vast fortune of his wife, Princess Marie of Antioch. This huge
building is described as “the finest baronial mansion in all the realm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
of Romania”; it contained sufficient rooms for an Emperor and his
court, and the walls were covered with frescoes illustrating the conquest
of the Holy Land, in which the ancestors of the Great Theban baron
had played a prominent part. Unhappily, the great castle of Thebes
was destroyed by the Catalans in the fourteenth century, and one
stumpy tower alone remains to preserve, like the Santameri mountains
in the Morea, the name and fame of the great Frankish family of St
Omer.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the political organisation of the two chief Frankish
states of Greece; I would next say something of their ecclesiastical
arrangements. The policy of the Franks towards the Greek Church
was more than anything else the determining factor of their success
or failure in Greece, for in all ages the Greeks have regarded their
Church as inseparably identified with their nationality, and even to-day
the terms “Christian” and “Greek” are often used as identical terms.
Now, as that fair-minded modern Greek historian, Paparregopoulos,
has pointed out, the Franks were confronted at the outset with an
ecclesiastical dilemma, from which there was no escape. Either they
must persecute the Orthodox Church, in which case they would make
bitter enemies of the persecuted clergy and of the Nicene and Byzantine
Emperors; or they must tolerate it, in which case their Greek subjects
would find natural leaders in the Orthodox bishops, who would sooner
or later conspire against their foreign rulers. This was exactly what
happened as soon as the Franks abandoned the policy of persecution
for that of toleration. At first, they simply annexed the existing Greek
ecclesiastical organisation, which had subsisted, with one or two small
changes, ever since the days of the Emperor Leo the Philosopher,
ousted the Orthodox hierarchy from their sees, and installed in their
places Catholic ecclesiastics from the West.</p>

<p>Thus, at Athens, a Frenchman, named Bérard, became the first
Catholic Archbishop of Athens, and thus began that long series which
existed without a break till the time of the Turkish conquest and was
subsequently renewed in 1875. Later on, however, when the Florentine
Dukes of Athens, at the end of the fourteenth century, permitted the
Greek Metropolitan to reside in his see, he at once entered into negotiations
with the Turks, and the same phenomenon meets us at Salona
and other places. As Voltaire has said, the Greek clergy “preferred
the turban of a Turkish priest to the red hat of a Roman Cardinal,”
and this strange preference contributed in great measure to the downfall
of Latin rule in the Levant. For, throughout the long period of the
Frankish domination, the Catholic Church made hardly any headway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
among the Greeks. The elder Sanudo, who knew the Levant better than
most of his contemporaries, wrote to Pope John XXII, that the Western
Powers might destroy the Byzantine Empire but could not retain their
conquests, for the examples of Cyprus, Crete, the principality of Achaia,
and the Duchy of Athens showed that only the foreign conquerors and
not the natives belonged to the Roman faith. Even to-day, the
Catholics of Greece come mostly from those Italian families, whose
ancestors emigrated to the Levant in the Frankish period, and are
mostly to be found just where we should expect to find them—in the
Ionian Islands and the Cyclades, that is to say, in the two places where
Latin rule lasted longest. Moreover, the Catholic Church did not receive
the consideration which it might have reasonably expected from the
Frankish rulers themselves. The correspondence of Innocent III, who
sat on the Chair of St Peter at the time of the conquest, is full of
complaints against the hostile attitude of the Franks towards the
Roman clergy. The Archbishop of Patras was not safe even in his own
palace, for the sacrilegious baron Aleman, who, as we saw, had received
that town as a fief, considered the Archiepiscopal plan of fortifying
the place against pirates as amateurish, carried the Primate off to
prison, cut off his representative’s nose, and converted the palace and
the adjacent church of St Theodore into the present castle. Geoffroy I
de Villehardouin neither paid tithes himself, nor compelled his subjects
to pay them; he forced the clergy to plead before the secular tribunals,
and exempted the Greek priests and monks from the jurisdiction of
the Catholic Archbishop. His son and successor, Geoffroy II, went even
farther in this secular policy. When the Latin clergy refused to perform
military service, on the ground that they owed obedience to the Pope
alone, he confiscated their fiefs and devoted the funds which he thus
obtained to building the great castle of Chlomoutsi, or Clermont, near
Glarentza in the West of Elis, the ruins of which still remain a striking
monument of the relations between Church and State in Frankish
Greece. This castle took three years to construct; and, as soon as it
was finished, Geoffroy laid the whole matter before Pope Honorius III.
He pointed out that if the Latin priests would not help him to fight
the Greeks, they would only have themselves to blame if the principality,
and with it their Church, fell under the sway of those Schismatics. The
Pope saw the force of this argument; the Prince ceased to appropriate
the revenues of the clergy; and peace reigned between the civil and
ecclesiastical authorities. It is interesting to note, that, under the
next Prince, the castle of Chlomoutsi became the mint of the principality,
whence coins known as <i>tournois</i>, or <i>tornesi</i>, because they bore on them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
a representation of the Church of St Martin of Tours, were issued for
more than a century. Many thousands of these coins have been found
in Greece, specimens may be seen in the Doge’s Palace and in the Museo
Correr at Venice, and from this Achaian currency the castle received
its Italian name of Castel Tornese. The town and harbour of Glarentza
near it rose to be the chief port of the principality. Boccaccio mentions
Genoese merchantmen there in one of the novels of the <i>Decameron</i>,
in which a “Prince of the Morea” is one of the characters; the famous
Florentine banking house of the Peruzzi had a branch there, and
Pegalotti describes to us the weights, measures, and customs duties
of this flourishing commercial place.</p>

<p>When we come to consider the social life of Frankish Greece, we are
struck by the prominent part which women played in it, and in political
life as well. The Salic law did not obtain in the Latin states of the
Levant, except at Naxos under the Crispi, and, without expressing any
opinion upon the thorny question of female suffrage, I do not think
that it can be denied that the participation of the weaker sex in the
government of a purely military community had disastrous effects.
It happened on two occasions that almost the entire baronage of
Frankish Greece was annihilated on the field of battle, and after the
former of these disasters—the battle of Pelagonia in 1259, in which
Prince William of Achaia was taken prisoner by the troops of the Greek
Emperor of Nice—the fate of the principality was decided by the
votes of its ladies. The Emperor Michael VIII was resolved to make the
best use of the advantage which the rashness of the Prince had placed
within his power, and demanded, as the price of his captive’s freedom,
the cession of the three great fortresses of Monemvasia, Mistra, and
Maina, the first of which had only recently been surrendered by the
Greeks to the Franks, while the other two had been erected by Prince
William himself. The question was submitted by Duke Guy I of Athens,
who was then acting as Regent of Achaia, to a Parliament, convened
at Nikli in 1262. At this “Ladies’ Parliament” there were only two
other men present—for all the men of mark were either in prison or had
been slain at Pelagonia—and their wives or widows had to take their
place at the Council. Naturally, an assembly so composed was guided
by sentiment rather than by reasons of high policy. In vain the statesmanlike
Duke of Athens argued in scriptural language, that “it were
better that one man should die for the people than that the other
Franks of the Morea should lose the fruits of their fathers’ labours”;
in vain, to show his disinterestedness, he offered to take the Prince’s
place in prison or to pledge his own Duchy to provide a ransom. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
conjugal feelings of the ladies prevailed, the three castles were surrendered,
and from that day dates the gradual recovery of the Morea
by the Greeks. Two noble dames were sent, in strict accordance with
feudal law, as hostages for their lord to Constantinople, and it is
interesting to note the ingratitude with which one of them was treated
by him in the sequel. While she was still in prison on his account, the
great barony of Matagrifon, to which she was entitled as next of kin,
fell vacant. But the Prince, who wished to bestow it upon one of his
daughters, declined to invest her with it, on the technical ground that
she had permitted the period of time allowed by the feudal code to
elapse without appearing to claim the fief. Unable to obtain justice,
she resorted to matrimony with one of the powerful barons of St Omer
as the only means of compelling the Prince to give her what was hers.
In this she was partially successful; but the incident throws a lurid
light on the chivalry of the brave warrior, whom the author of the
<i>Chronicle of the Morea</i> has made his hero.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to present a few portraits of the leading
women of Frankish Greece. There were the two daughters of Prince
William, of whom the elder, Princess Isabelle, succeeded him and whose
hand was eagerly sought in marriage by three husbands; her younger
sister, Marguérite, died in the grim castle of Chlomoutsi, the prisoner
of the turbulent Moreote barons, who never forgave her for having
married her daughter without their approval. There was Isabelle’s
daughter, Matilda, who had already been twice a widow when she was
only 23, and who was left all alone to govern the principality, where
every proud feudal lord claimed to do what was right in his own eyes.
Compelled by King Robert “the Wise” of Naples to go through the
form of marriage with his brother, John of Gravina, a man whom she
loathed, she was imprisoned for her contumacity in the Castel dell’ Uovo
of Naples. There were the three Duchesses of Athens—Helene Angela,
widow of Duke William, Regent for her son, and the first Greek who
had governed Athens for 80 years; Maria Melissene, widow of Duke
Antonio I, who tried to betray the Duchy to her countrymen the Greeks;
and most tragic of all, Chiara Giorgio, a veritable villain of melodrama,
widow of Nerio II, who fell in love with a young Venetian noble,
induced him by the offer of her hand and land to poison the wife whom
he had left behind in his palace at Venice, and expiated her crime before
the altar of the Virgin at Megara at the hands of the last Frankish
Duke of Athens, thus causing the Turkish conquest. Of like mould
was the Dowager Countess of Salona, whose evil government drove
her subjects to call in the Turks, and whose beautiful daughter, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
last Countess of that historic castle, ended her days in the Sultan’s
harem. Another of these masculine dames was Francesca Acciajuoli,
wife of Carlo Tocco, the Palatine Count of Cephalonia, the ablest and
most masterful woman of the Latin Orient, who used to sign her letters
in cinnabar ink “Empress of the Romans.” In her castles at Sta
Maura and at Cephalonia she presided over a bevy of fair ladies, and
Froissart has quaintly described the splendid hospitality with which
she received the French nobles, whom the Turks had taken prisoners
at the battle of Nikopolis on the Danube. “The ladies,” writes the old
French chronicler, “were exceeding glad to have such noble society,
for Venetian and Genoese merchants were, as a rule, the only strangers
who came to their delightful island.” He tells us, that Cephalonia was
ruled by women, who scorned not, however, to make silken coverings so
fine, that there was none like them. Fairies and nymphs inhabited this
ancient realm of Odysseus, where a mediæval Penelope held sway in
the absence of her lord! Yet another fair dame of the Frankish world,
the Duchess Fiorenza Sanudo of Naxos, occupied for years the astute
diplomatists of Venice, who were resolved that so eligible a young
widow should marry none but a Venetian, and who at last, when suitors
of other nationalities became pressing, had the Duchess kidnapped
and conveyed to Crete, where she was plainly told that, if she ever
wished to see her beloved Naxos again, she must marry the candidate
of the Most Serene Republic. And finally, we have the portrait of a
more feminine woman than most of these ladies, Marulla of Verona,
a noble damsel of Negroponte, whom old Ramon Muntaner describes
from personal acquaintance as “one of the fairest Christians in the
world, the best woman and the wisest that ever was in that land.”</p>

<p>Social life must have been far more brilliant in the hey-day of the
Frankish rule than anything that Greece had witnessed for centuries.
The <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i> tells us, that the Achaian nobles in their
castles “lived the fairest life that a man can,” and has preserved the
account of the great tournament on the Isthmus of Corinth—a mediæval
revival of the Isthmian games—which Philip of Savoy, at that time
Prince of Achaia, organised in 1305. From all parts of the Frankish
world men came in answer to the summons of the Prince. There were
Duke Guy II of Athens with a brave body of knights, the Marquess
of Boudonitza and the three barons of Eubœa, the Duke of the
Archipelago and the Palatine Count of Cephalonia, the Marshal of
Achaia, Nicholas de St Omer, with a following of Theban vassals, and
many another lesser noble. Messengers had been sent throughout the
highlands and islands of the Latin Orient to proclaim to all and sundry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
how seven champions had come from beyond the seas and did challenge
the chivalry of Romania to joust with them. Never had the fair land
of Hellas seen a braver sight than that presented by the lists at Corinth
in the lovely month of May, when the sky and the twin seas were at
their fairest. More than 1000 knights and barons took part in the
tournament, which lasted for twenty days, while all the fair ladies of
Achaia and Athens “rained influence” on the combatants. There were
the seven champions, clad in their armour of green taffetas covered with
scales of gold; there was the Prince of Achaia, who acquitted himself
right nobly in the lists, as a son of Savoy should, with all his household.
Most impetuous of all was the Duke of Athens, eager to match his
skill in horsemanship and with the lance against Master William
Bouchart, accounted one of the best jousters of the West. The chivalrous
Bouchart would fain have spared his less experienced antagonist; but
the Duke, who had cunningly padded himself beneath his plate armour,
was determined to meet him front to front; their horses collided with
such force that the iron spike of Bouchart’s charger pierced Guy’s
steed between the shoulders, so that horse and rider rolled in the dust.
St Omer would fain have met the Count John of Cephalonia in the
lists; but the Palatine, fearing the Marshal’s doughty arm, pretended
that his horse could not bear him into the ring, nor could he be shamed
into the combat, when Bouchart rode round and round the lists on
the animal, crying aloud, “This is the horse which would not go to
the jousts!” So they kept high revel on the Isthmus; alas! it was the
last great display of the chivalry of “New France”; six years later,
many a knight who had ridden proudly past the dames of the Morea,
lay a mangled corpse on the swampy plain of Bœotia, the victim of
the knife of Aragon. Besides tournaments, hunting was one of the
great attractions of life in mediæval Greece; we hear, too, of an archery
match in Crete, at which the archers represented different nations;
we are told of great balls held in Negroponte, which the gay Lombard
society of that island attended; and mention is made of the jongleurs
who were attached to the brilliant Court of Thebes. Muntaner, who
knew Duke Guy II and had visited his capital, has given us a charming
account of the ceremony in the Theban Minster, when the last De la
Roche came of age and received the order of knighthood—“a duty
which the King of France or the Emperor himself would have thought
it an honour to perform, for the Duke was one of the noblest men in
all Romania who was not a King, and eke one of the richest.” The
episode gives us some idea of the wealth and splendour and open-handed
generosity of the Burgundian Dukes of Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to say something about Frankish influence
on the language and literature of Greece. We are specially told that
the Franks of Achaia spoke most excellent French; but, at the same time,
there is direct evidence, that in the second generation, at any rate,
they also spoke Greek. The <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i> describes how Prince
William of Achaia after the battle of Pelagonia addressed his captor
in that language, and Duke John of Athens, according to Sanudo,
once used a Greek phrase, which is a quotation from Herodotus. Later
on, the Florentine Dukes of Athens drew up many of their documents
in Greek, just as Mohammed II employed that language in his diplomatic
communications. The Venetian Governors of Eubœa, however, who
held office for only two years, had to employ an interpreter, who is
specially mentioned in one of the Venetian documents. While a number
of French feudal and Italian terms crept into the Greek language, as
may be seen in the Cyclades at the present day, and especially in the
Venetian island of Tenos, the Franks covered the map of Greece with
a strange and weird nomenclature. Thus, Lacedæmonia became “La
Crémonie,” the first syllable being mistaken for the definite article;
Athens was known as “Satines,” or “Sethines,” Thebes as “Estives,”
Naupaktos as “Lepanto,” Zeitounion, the modern Lamia, as “Gipton,”
Kalavryta as “La Grite,” Salona as “La Sole,” Lemnos as “Stalimene,”
and the island of Samothrace as “Sanctus Mandrachi.” Most wonderful
transformation of all, Cape Sunium becomes in one Venetian document
“Pellestello” (πολλοὶ στῦλοι), from the “Many columns” of the temple,
which gave it its usual Italian name of “Cape Colonna.”</p>

<p>The Franks have too often been accused of being barbarians, whereas
there is evidence that they were not indifferent to literature. Among the
conquerors were not a few poets. Conon de Béthune was a writer of
poems as well as an orator; Geoffroy I of Achaia composed some verses
which have been preserved; Rambaud de Vaqueiras, the troubadour
of Boniface of Montferrat, was rewarded for his songs by lands in
Greece. Count John II Orsini of Epeiros ordered Constantine Hermoniakos
to make a paraphrase of Homer in octosyllabic verse. We may say
of this production, as Bentley said of Pope’s translation of the <i>Iliad</i>,
“it is a pretty poem, but you must not call it Homer”; still it is interesting
to find a Latin ruler patronising Greek literature. The courtly
poet was so delighted that he tells us that his master was “a hero and
a scholar,” and that the Lady Anna of Epeiros “excelled all women
that ever lived in beauty, wisdom, and learning.” Historical accuracy
compels me to add that the “heroic and scholarly” Count had gained
his throne by the murder of his brother, while the “beautiful, wise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and learned” Anna assassinated her husband! Throughout a great
part of the Frankish period, too, people were engaged in transcribing
Greek manuscripts. Several Athenians copied medical treatises, William
of Meerbeke, the Latin Archbishop of Corinth in 1280, whose name
survives in the Argive Church of Merbaka<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, translated Hippocrates,
Galen, Aristotle, and Proklos, and one of the Tocchi—the Italian
family which followed the Orsini as Counts of Cephalonia—employed
a monk to copy for him manuscripts of Origen and Chrysostom. Yet,
in 1309, a Theban canon had to go to the West to continue his studies;
and, a century later, the Archbishop of Patras obtained leave to study
at the University of Bologna.</p>

<p>But the chief literary monument of Frankish Greece is the <i>Chronicle
of the Morea</i>—the very curious work which exists in four versions,
Greek, French, Italian, and Spanish. The Italian version need not
detain us, for it contains no new facts and is merely an abbreviated
translation of the Greek, chiefly remarkable for the extraordinary, but
characteristic, mutilation of the proper names. The Spanish version,
made in 1393 by order of Heredia, the romantic Grand-Master of the
Knights of St John, and the French version, found in the castle of
St Omer—another proof of Frankish culture—are of great historic
interest. But by far the most remarkable of all the four versions is
the Greek—a poem of some 9000 lines in the usual jog-trot “political”
metre of most mediæval and modern Greek poetry, composed, in my
opinion, by a half-caste lawyer, who obviously had the most enthusiastic
admiration for the Franks, to whom he doubtless owed his place and
salary. With the exception of a few French feudal terms, this most
remarkable poem may be read without the slightest difficulty by any
modern Greek scholar,—a striking proof that the vulgar Greek spoken
to-day is almost exactly the same as that in common use in the first
half of the fourteenth century, when the <i>Chronicle</i> was composed.
As regards its literary merits, opinions differ. As a rule, it is merely
prose in the form of verse; but here and there, the author rises to a
much higher level, and his work is a store-house of social, and especially
legal information, even where his chronology and history have been
shown by documentary evidence to be inaccurate.</p>

<p>The bright and chivalrous Frankish society has long passed away;
but a few Italian and Catalan families still linger in the Cyclades, there
are still Venetian names and titles in the Ionian Islands; the Tocchi
were till lately represented at Naples and the Zorzi still are at Venice;
the towers of Thebes and Paros, the Norman arch of Andravida, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
noble castles of Karytaina and Chlomoutsi, and the carvings and
frescoes of Geraki still remind us of the romance of feudal Greece,
when every coign of vantage had its lord, and from every donjon
floated the banner of a baron.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">3. THE PRINCES OF THE PELOPONNESE</h3>

<p>It is satisfactory to note that, after a long period of neglect, the
great romance of mediæval Greek history is finding interpreters.
Since George Finlay revealed to the British public the fact that the
annals of Greece were by no means a blank in the Middle Ages, and
that Athens was a flourishing city in the thirteenth century, much fresh
material has been collected, by both Greek and German scholars, from
the Venetian and other archives, which throws fresh light upon the
dark places of the Latin rule in the Levant. Finlay’s work can never
lose its value. Its author had not the microscopic zeal for genealogies
and minutiæ which distinguished Hopf; but he possessed gifts and
advantages of a far higher order. He knew Greece and the Greeks
as no other foreign scholar has known them; he had a deep insight into
the causes of political and social events; he drew his picture, as the
Germans say, <i>in grossen Zügen</i>, and he left a work which no student
of mediæval Greece can afford to ignore, and every statesman engaged
in Eastern affairs would do well to read. All that is now wanted is
for some one to do in England what Gregorovius did in so agreeable
a manner for the Germans—to make the dry bones of the Frank
chivalry live again, and to set before us in flesh and blood the Dukes
of Athens and the Princes of Achaia, the Marquesses of Boudonitza,
the Lords of Salona, the Dukes of the Archipelago, and the three
barons of Eubœa. Despite the vandalism of mere archæologists, who
can see nothing of interest in an age when Greeks were shaky in their
declensions, and of bigoted purists among the Greeks themselves, who
strive to erase every evidence of foreign rule alike from their language
and their land, the feudal castles of the Morea, of continental Greece,
and of the islands, still remind us of the days when classic Hellas, as
Pope Honorius III said, was “New France,” when armoured knights
and fair Burgundian damsels attended Mass in St Mary’s Minster on
the Akropolis, and jousts were held on the Isthmus of Corinth.</p>

<p>Of the Frankish period of Greek history the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i>
is the most curious literary production, valuable alike as an historical
source—save for occasional errors of dates and persons, especially in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the earlier part—and as a subject for linguistic study. The present
edition, the fruit of many years’ labour, is almost wholly devoted to
the latter aspect of the <i>Chronicle</i>, about which there is much that is
of interest. Versions exist in French, in Italian, and in Aragonese, as
well as in Greek; and the question as to whether the Greek or the French
was the original has been much discussed. The present editor, differing
from Buchon and Hopf, believes that the French <i>Livre de la Conqueste</i>
could not have been the original. In any case, the Greek <i>Chronicle</i>
is of more literary interest than the French, because it throws a strong
light on modern Greek. Any person familiar with the modern colloquial
language could read with ease, except for a few French feudal terms,
this fourteenth century popular poem, many of whose phrases might
come from the racy conversation of any Greek peasant of to-day, and
is very different from the classical imitation of the contemporary
Byzantine historians. Its poetic merits are small, nor does the jog-trot
“political” metre in which it is composed tend to lofty flights of poetry.
We know not who was its author; but, on the whole, there seems to
be reason for believing that he was a Gasmoulos—one of the offspring
of mixed marriages between Greeks and Franks—probably employed,
as his love of legal nomenclature shows, in some clerkly post. Unpoetical
himself, he has at least been the cause of noble poetry in others; for,
as Dr Schmitt shows, the second part of Goethe’s <i>Faust</i> has been
largely inspired by its perusal; and the hero of that drama finds his
prototype in the chivalrous builder of Mistra.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No chapter of this mediæval romance is more striking than the
conquest of the Morea by the Franks and the history of their rule in
the classic peninsula. At the time of the fourth crusade the Peloponnese
was a prey to that spirit of particularism which has been, unhappily,
too often characteristic of the Greeks in ancient, in mediæval, and in
modern times. Instead of uniting among themselves in view of the
Latin peril, the great <i>archontes</i> of the Morea availed themselves of the
general confusion to occupy strong positions and to extend their own
authority at the expense of their neighbours. The last historian and
statesman of Constantinople before the Latin conquest, Niketas of
Chonæ, has left us a sad picture of the demoralisation of society in
Greece at that critical moment. The leading men, he says, instead of
fighting, cringed to the conquerors; some were inflamed by ambition
against their own country, slavish creatures, spoiled by luxury, who
made themselves tyrants, instead of opposing the Latins<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
<i>archontes</i> the most prominent was Leon Sgouros, hereditary lord of
Nauplia, who had seized the Larissa of Argos and the impregnable
citadel high above Corinth, and who, though he failed to imitate the
heroism of Leonidas in the Pass of Thermopylæ, held out at Akrocorinth
till his death.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the country when a winter storm drove into
the haven of Modon, on the Messenian coast, Geoffroy de Villehardouin,
a crusader from Champagne, and nephew of the chronicler of the
conquest of Constantinople. A Greek <i>archon</i> of the neighbourhood,
thinking that the opportunity was too good to be lost, invited the
storm-bound warrior to aid him in the conquest of the surrounding
country. Geoffroy was nothing loth; and the two unnatural allies
speedily subdued one place after another. But, as ill-luck would have
it, the Greek died; and his son, more patriotic or less trustworthy than
the father, broke the compact with the Frankish intruder, and turned
Geoffroy out of his quickly-won possessions. The crusader’s position
was serious; he was in a hostile country and surrounded by an alien
and suspicious population; but he was a man of resource, and, hearing
that Boniface, Marquess of Montferrat and King of Salonika, had made
a triumphal march through continental Greece and was at that moment
besieging the great stronghold of Nauplia, he set out across the
Peloponnese—a six days’ journey—and succeeded in reaching the
Frankish camp. There he found an old friend and neighbour, Guillaume
de Champlitte, to whom he confided the scheme which he had been
revolving in his mind. “I come,” he said, so we learn from his uncle’s
chronicle, “from a land which is very rich, and men call it the Morea”—a
name which here occurs for the first time in the history of Greece,
and the origin of which is still a puzzle to all her historians. He urged
Champlitte to join him in the task of conquering this El Dorado,
promising to recognise him as his liege lord in return for his assistance.
Champlitte agreed, and the two friends, at the head of a small body
of a hundred knights and some esquires, started on their bold venture<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>The ease with which the little band of Western warriors conquered
the peninsula, which had once produced the Spartan warriors, strikes
every reader of the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i>—the prosaic, but extremely
curious and valuable poem in which the Frank conquest is described.
The cause lay partly in the disunited state of Greek society and the
feuds of the local <i>archontes</i>, but still more in the neglect of military
training, due to the fact that the Byzantine emperors had long drawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
their best troops from the non-Hellenic portions of their heterogeneous
dominions. It is remarkable that, apart from Sgouros, interned, as it
were, on Akrocorinth, and a Greek <i>archon</i>, Doxapatres, who held a
small but strongly situated castle in one of the gorges of Arcadia, the
invaders met with little opposition. Greece, as we know from the
complaints of Michael Akominatos, the last orthodox Archbishop of
Athens before the conquest, had been plundered by Byzantine tax-gatherers
and despised as a “Scythian wilderness” by Byzantine
officials. So, when the inhabitants found that the Franks had no
intention of interfering with their prized municipal privileges, they had
no great objection to exchanging a master who spent their money at
Constantinople for one who spent it in Elis at the new Peloponnesian
capital of Andreville or Andravida. One pitched battle decided the
fate of “the isle of Greece,” as the Franks sometimes called it. At the
olive grove of Koundoura, in the north-east of Messenia, the small
force of Franks easily routed a Greek army six times larger; and as
the chronicler, always in sympathy with the invaders, puts it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Αὐτὸν καὶ μόνον τὸν πόλεμον ἐποῖκαν οἱ Ρωμαῖοι</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Εἰς τὸν καιρὸν ποὺ ἐκέρδισαν οἱ Φράγκοι τὸν Μορέαν.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet a modern Greek historian of singular fairness, the late K. Paparregopoulos,
has remarked how great was the change in the Turkish times.
The descendants of the unwarlike Moreotes, who fell so easy a prey to
the Frankish chivalry in 1205, never lost an opportunity of rising against
the Turks after the Frankish domination was over. As he justly says,
one of the main results of the long Latin rule was to teach Greek
“hands to war and their fingers to fight.”</p>

<p>Thus, almost by a single blow, the Franks had become masters of
the ancient “island of Pelops.” Here and there a few natural strongholds
still held out. Even after the death of Sgouros his triple crown
of forts, Corinth, Nauplia, and Argos, was still defended for the Greek
cause in the name of the lord, or Despot, of Epeiros, where a bold
scion of the imperial house of Angelos had founded an independent
state on the ruins of the Byzantine Empire. The great rock of Monemvasia
in the south-east of the Morea, whence our ancestors derived
their Malmsey wine, remained in the hands of its three local <i>archontes</i>;
while, in the mountains of southern Lakonia, a race which had often
defied Byzantium scorned to acknowledge the noblemen of Champagne.
The local magnate, Joannes Chamaretos, could boast for a time that
he kept his own lands in Lakonia, but he, too, had to take refuge at
the Epeirote Court at Arta<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Finally, the two Messenian ports of Modon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
and Koron were claimed by Venice, which, with her usual astuteness,
had secured those valuable stations on the way to Egypt in the deed of
partition by which the conquerors of the empire had divided the spoils
among themselves at Constantinople. Not without reason did Pope
Innocent III, whose letters are full of allusions to the Frankish organisation
of Greece, style Guillaume de Champlitte “Prince of all Achaia.”</p>

<p>Champlitte now attempted to provide for the internal government
of his principality by the application of the feudal system, which,
even before the Frankish conquest, had crept into many parts of the
Levant. The <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i>, whose author revels in legal details,
gives an account of the manner in which “the isle of Greece” was
organised by its new masters. A commission, consisting of two Latin
bishops, two bannerets, and five Greek <i>archontes</i>, under the presidency
of Geoffroy de Villehardouin, drew up a species of Domesday-book for
the new state. In accordance with the time-honoured feudal custom,
twelve baronies were created and bestowed upon prominent members
of the Frankish force, who were bound to be at the prince’s beck and
call with their retainers in time of need; and the castles of these warrior
barons were purposely erected in strong positions, whence they could
command important passes or overcome troublesome neighbours. Even
to-day the traveller may see the fine fortress above the town of Patras
which Guillaume Aleman, one of the feudatories, constructed out of
the Archbishop’s palace; the castle of Karytaina, the Toledo of Greece,
still reminds us of the time when Hugues de Bruyères held the dalesmen
of Skorta, ancestors of M. Delyannes, in check; and, far to the South,
the war-cry of Jean de Neuilly, hereditary Marshal of Achaia, <i>Passe
avant</i>, lingers in the name of Passavâ, the stronghold which once
inspired respect in the men of Maina, who boast that they spring
from Spartan mothers. Seven ecclesiastical peers, the Latin Archbishop
of Patras at their head, and the three military orders of St John, the
Templars, and the Teutonic Knights also received fiefs; and, while
Geoffroy de Villehardouin was invested with Kalamata and Kyparissia,
fertile Elis became the princely domain.</p>

<p>But Guillaume de Champlitte did not long enjoy his Achaian
dignity. If he was a prince in Greece he was still a French subject;
and the death of his brother made it necessary for him to do homage
in person for his fief in France. On the way he died; and the cunning
Villehardouin, by an ingenious stratagem, contrived to become master
of the country. It had been declared that a claimant must take possession
of Achaia within a year and a day after the date of the last
vacancy; and Geoffroy contrived to have Champlitte’s heir detained in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Venice and left behind at Corfù till the fatal date had almost passed.
A little skilful manœuvring from one place to another in the Morea
filled up the rest of the time, so that, when young Robert de Champlitte
at last met Geoffrey in full court at Lacedæmonia, the mediæval town
which had risen near the Eurotas, the year and a day had already
elapsed. The court decided in favour of Geoffrey, anxious, no doubt,
that their ruler should be a statesman of experience and not a young
man fresh from France. Robert gave no further trouble, and Geoffrey
remained for the rest of his days “Lord of Achaia.” By his tact and
cleverness he had contrived to win the regard both of the Frank barons
and of the Greek population, whose religion and ancient customs he
had sworn to respect. He was thus enabled to subdue the three outstanding
fortresses which had once been the domain of Sgouros, while
he settled all claims that the Venetians might have upon the Morea
by allowing them to keep Modon and Koron, granting them a separate
quarter in every town in his principality, and doing homage to them
for the whole peninsula on the island of Sapienza. He crowned his
career by marrying his son to the daughter of the Latin Emperor
Peter of Courtenay, from whose family the Earls of Devon are descended.</p>

<p>Under his son and successor, Geoffrey II, the Frank principality
prospered exceedingly. The Venetian historian, Marino Sanudo, who
derived much of his information from his relative, Marco II Sanudo,
Duke of Naxos, has given us a vivid picture of life at the Peloponnesian
court under the rule of the second of the Villehardouins. A just prince,
Geoffrey II used to send his friends from time to time to the baronial
castles of the Morea to see how the barons treated their vassals. At
his own court he kept “eighty knights with golden spurs”; and “knights
came to the Morea from France, from Burgundy, and above all from
Champagne, to follow him. Some came to amuse themselves, others to
pay their debts, others again because of crimes which they had committed<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.”
In fact, towards the middle of the thirteenth century, the
Morea had become for the younger sons of the French chivalry much
what the British colonies were to adventurers and ne’er-do-weels fifty
years ago. It was a place where the French knights would find their
own language spoken—we are specially told what good French was
spoken in Greece in the Frankish period—and could scarcely fail to
obtain congenial employment from a prince of their own race.</p>

<p>One difficulty, however, had soon arisen in the Frank principality.
The Latin clergy, who had had their full share of the spoils, declined
to take any part in the defence of the country. Geoffrey, with all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the energy of his race, opposed a stout resistance to these clerical
pretensions, and confiscated the ecclesiastical fiefs, spending the proceeds
upon the erection of the great castle of Clermont or Chlomoutsi
above the busy port of Glarentza, the imposing ruins of which are still
a land-mark for miles around. When he had finished the castle Geoffroy
appealed to the Pope, placing before the Holy Father the very practical
argument that, if the principality, through lack of defenders, were
recaptured by the Greeks, the loss would fall just as much on the
Roman Church as on the prince, while the fault would be entirely with
the former. The Pope was sufficiently shrewd to see that Geoffroy was
right; the dispute was settled amicably; and both the prince and the
Latin clergy subscribed generously for the preservation of the moribund
Latin empire, which exercised a nominal suzerainty over the principality
of Achaia.</p>

<p>Geoffroy’s brother and successor, the warlike Guillaume de Villehardouin,
saw the Frank state in the Morea reach its zenith, and by
his rashness contributed to its decline. Born in Greece, and speaking
Greek, as the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i> expressly tells us, the third of the
Villehardouins began by completing the conquest of what was his
native land. It was he who laid siege to the rock of Monemvasia for
three long years, till at last, when the garrison had been reduced to
eat mice and cats, the three <i>archontes</i> advanced along the narrow causeway
which gives the place its name<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, and surrendered on terms which
the prince wisely granted. It was he, too, who built the noble castle
of Mistra on the site of the Homeric Messe, now abandoned to tortoises
and sheep, but for two centuries a great name in the history of Greece.
To a ruler so vigorous and so determined even the weird Tzakones,
that strange tribe, perhaps Slavs but far more probably Dorians, which
still lingers on and cherishes its curious language around Leonidi,
yielded obedience; while the men of Maina, hemmed in by two new
castles, ceased to trouble.</p>

<p>For the first and last time in its history the whole Peloponnese owned
the sway of a Frank prince, except where, at Modon and Koron,
Venice kept “its right eye,” as it called those places, fixed on the East.
So powerful a sovereign as St Louis of France wished that he had some
of Guillaume’s knights to aid him in his Egyptian war; and from seven
hundred to one thousand horsemen always attended the chivalrous
Prince of Achaia. His court at La Crémonie, the French version of
Lacedæmonia, was “more brilliant than that of many a king”; and
this brilliance was not merely on the surface. “Merchants,” says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Sanudo, “went up and down without money, and lodged in the house
of the bailies; and on their simple note of hand people gave them
money<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.” But Guillaume’s ambition and his love of fighting for fighting’s
sake involved the principality in disaster. Not content with beginning
the first fratricidal war between the Frank rulers of the East by
attacking Guy de la Roche, Lord of Athens, he espoused the cause
of his father-in-law, the Greek Despot of Epeiros, then engaged in
another brotherly struggle with the Greek Emperor of Nice. On the
field of Pelagonia in Macedonia the Franks were routed; and the Prince
of Achaia, easily recognised by his prominent teeth, was dragged from
under a heap of straw, where he was lying, and carried off a prisoner
to the court of the Emperor Michael VIII.</p>

<p>Guillaume’s captivity was the cause of endless evils for the principality;
for Michael, who in 1261, by the recapture of Constantinople,
had put an end to the short-lived Latin empire and restored there the
throne of the Greeks, was resolved to regain a footing in the Morea
and to make use of his distinguished captive for that purpose. He
accordingly demanded, as the price of the prince’s freedom, the three
strong fortresses of Mistra, Monemvasia, and Maina. The matter was
referred to a ladies’ parliament held at Nikli, near the site of the
ancient Tegea, for so severe had been the losses of the Frank chivalry
that the noble dames of the Morea had to take the places of their
husbands. We can well understand that, with a tribunal so composed,
sentiment and the ties of affection would have more influence than the
<i>raison d’état</i>. Yet Guillaume’s old opponent, Guy de la Roche, now
Duke of Athens and bailie of Achaia during the prince’s captivity,
laid before the parliament the argument that it was better that one
man should die for the people than that the rest of the Franks should
lose the Morea<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. At the same time, to show that he bore no malice, he
chivalrously offered to go to prison in place of the prince. But the
ladies of the Morea thought otherwise. It was decided to give up the
three castles; and two of the fair châtelaines were sent as hostages to
Constantinople.</p>

<p>Thus, in 1262, the Byzantine Government regained a foothold in
the Morea; a Byzantine province was created, with Mistra as its
capital, and entrusted at first to a general of distinction annually
appointed, and ultimately conferred as an appanage for life upon the
Emperor’s second son. The native Greeks of the whole peninsula thus
had a rallying-point in the Byzantine province, and the suspicion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the Franks that the surrender of the three fortresses “might prove to
be their ruin<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>,” turned out to be only too well-founded. As for the
Franks who were left in the Byzantine portion of the Morea, their
fate is obscure. Probably, as Dr Schmitt thinks, some emigrated to
the gradually dwindling Frankish principality, while others became
merged in the mass of Greeks around them. In all ages the Hellenes,
like the Americans of to-day, have shown the most marvellous capacity
for absorbing the various races which have come within their borders.
A yet further element of evil omen for the country was introduced
in consequence of this partial restoration of the Byzantine power. As
might have been foreseen, the easy morality of that age speedily
absolved the prince from his solemn oaths to the Emperor, and he
was scarcely released when a fresh war broke out between them. It
was then, for the first time, that we hear of Turks in the Morea—men
who had been sent there as mercenaries by the Emperor Michael.
Careless whom they served, so long as they were paid regularly, these
Oriental soldiers of fortune deserted to the prince; and those who
cared to settle in the country received lands and wives, whose offspring
were still living, when the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i> was written (p. 372),
at two places in the peninsula.</p>

<p>Unhappily for the principality, as the chronicler remarks, Guillaume
de Villehardouin left no male heir; and nothing more strongly justifies
the Salic law than the history of the Franks in the Morea, where it
was not applied. Anxious to take what precautions he could against
the disruption of his dominions after his death, the last of the Villehardouin
princes married his elder daughter Isabelle to the second son
of Charles of Anjou, the most powerful sovereign in the south of
Europe at that time, who, in addition to his other titles, had received
from the last Latin Emperor of the East, then a fugitive at Viterbo,
the suzerainty over the principality of Achaia, hitherto held by the
Emperor. This close connection with the great house of Anjou, to which
the kingdom of the Two Sicilies then belonged, seemed to provide
Achaia with the strongest possible support. The support, too, was
near at hand; for communication between Italy and Glarentza, the
chief port of the Morea, was, as we know from the novels of Boccaccio,
not infrequent; and we hear of Frankish nobles from Achaia making
pilgrimages to the two great Apulian sanctuaries of St Nicholas of
Bari and Monte Santangelo. But, when Guillaume de Villehardouin
died in 1278 and was laid beside his brother and father in the family
mausoleum at Andravida (where excavations, made in 1890, failed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
find their remains)<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, his daughter Isabelle was still a minor, though
already a widow.</p>

<p>The government of the principality accordingly fell into the hands
of bailies appointed by the suzerain at Naples. Sometimes the bailie
was a man who knew the country, like Nicholas St Omer, whose name
is still perpetuated by the St Omer tower at Thebes and the Santameri
mountains not far from Patras; sometimes he was a foreigner, who
knew little of the country, and, in the words which the <i>Chronicle</i> (p. 544)
puts into the mouths of two Frankish nobles, “tyrannised over the
poor, wronged the rich, and sought his own profit.” The complainants
warned Charles II of Anjou, who was now their suzerain, that he was
going the right way to “lose the principality”; and the King of Naples
took their advice. He bestowed the hand of the widowed Isabelle
upon a young Flemish nobleman, Florenz of Hainault, who was then
at his court, and who thus became Prince of the Morea. Florenz wisely
made peace with the Byzantine province, so that “all became rich,
both Franks and Greeks,” and the land recovered from the effects
of war and maladministration. But the Flemings, who had crowded
over to Greece at the news of their countryman’s good fortune, were
less scrupulous than their prince and provoked reprisals from the
Greeks, from whom they sought to wring money. On the other hand,
it would seem that the natives of the Byzantine province were able
to secure good treatment from the Emperor, for there is preserved
in that interesting little collection, the Christian Archæological Museum
at Athens, a golden bull of Andronikos II, dated 1293, concerning the
privileges of the sacred rock of Monemvasia. When the modern Greeks
come to think more highly of their mediæval history, they should
regard that rugged crag with reverence. For two centuries it was the
guardian of their municipal and national liberties.</p>

<p>Florenz of Hainault lived too short a time for the welfare of the
Morea; and Isabelle, once more a widow, was married again in Rome
(whither she had gone for the first papal jubilee of 1300) to a prince
of the doughty house of Savoy, which thus became concerned with
the affairs of Greece. Philip of Savoy was at the time in possession of
Piedmont; and, as might have been expected, Piedmontese methods
of government were not adapted to the latitude of Achaia. He was a
man fond of spending, and an adept at extorting, money. The microscopic
Dr Hopf has unearthed from the archives at Turin the bill—a
fairly extensive one—for his wedding-breakfast; and the magnificent
tournament which he organised on the Isthmus of Corinth, and in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
all the Frankish rulers of Greece took part, occupied a thousand knights
for more than twenty days. “He had learned money-making at home,”
it was said, when the extravagant prince from Piedmont let it be
understood that he expected presents from his vassals, and imposed
taxes on the privileged inhabitants of Skorta. But the days of the
Savoyard in Achaia were numbered. The house of Anjou, suzerains
of the principality, had never looked with favour on his marriage with
Isabelle; an excuse was found for deposing him in favour of another
Philip, of Taranto, son of the King of Naples. To make matters smoother,
Isabelle and her husband received, as some compensation for relinquishing
all claims to the Morea, a small strip of territory on the
shores of the Fucine lake. They both left Greece for ever. Isabelle
died in Holland; and Philip of Savoy sleeps in the family vault at
Pinerolo, near Turin, leaving to his posterity by a second marriage
the empty title of “Prince of Achaia.”</p>

<p>The house of Villehardouin was not yet extinct. Isabelle had a
daughter, Matilda of Hainault, whose husband, Louis of Burgundy,
was permitted, by the tortuous policy of the Neapolitan Angevins, to
govern the principality. But a rival claimant now appeared in the field
in the person of Fernando of Majorca, one of the most adventurous
personages of those adventurous times, who is well known to us from
the quaint Catalan Chronicle of Ramon Muntaner. Fernando had
already had his full share of the vicissitudes of life. He had been at
one time head of the Catalan Grand Company, which had just won
the Duchy of Athens on the swampy meadows of the Bœotian Kephissos,
and he had sat a prisoner in the castle of Thebes, the famous Kadmeia,
whose walls were painted with the exploits of the crusaders in the
Holy Land. He had married the daughter of Guillaume de Villehardouin’s
younger child, the Lady of Akova, and he claimed Achaia in the name
of his dead wife’s infant son. Such was the violence of the age that
both the rivals perished in the struggle, Fernando on the scaffold,
and Louis of Burgundy by a poison administered to him by one of the
petty potentates of Greece. Even more miserable was the end of the
unhappy Matilda. Invited by the unscrupulous King of Naples to
his court, she was informed that she must marry his brother, John
of Gravina. With the true spirit of a Villehardouin, the Princess refused;
and even the Pope himself, whose authority was invoked, could not
make her yield. She had already, she said, married again, and must
decline to commit bigamy. This gave the King of Naples the opportunity
he sought. He declared that, by marrying without her suzerain’s
consent, she had forfeited her principality, which he bestowed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
his brother. The helpless Princess was thrown into the Castel dell’ Uovo
at Naples, and was afterwards allowed to die a lingering death in
that island-prison, the last of her race. So ended the dynasty of the
Villehardouins.</p>

<p>Grievous, indeed, was the situation of the Franks in Greece at this
moment. Though little more than a hundred years had elapsed since
the conquest, the families of the conquerors were almost extinct. The
terrible blow dealt at the Frank chivalry by the rude Catalans, almost
on the very battlefield of Chaironeia, was as fatal to Frankish, as was
the victory of Philip of Macedon to free, Greece. Of the barons who had
taken part in that contest, where many Achaian nobles had stood by
the side of the headstrong Athenian duke, only four survived. Moreover,
the Frank aristocracy, as Finlay has pointed out, committed racial
suicide by constituting themselves an exclusive class. Intermarriages
with the Greeks took place, it is true; and a motley race, known as
Gasmoûloi<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, the offspring of these unions, of whom the author of the
<i>Chronicle</i> was perhaps a member, fell into the usual place of half-castes
in the East. But Muntaner expressly says that the nobles of Achaia
usually took their wives from France. Meanwhile new men had taken
possession of some of the old baronies—Flemings, Neapolitans, and
even Florentines, one of whom, Nicholas Acciajuoli, whose splendid
tomb is to be seen in the Certosa near Florence, laid on the rocks of
Akrocorinth the foundations of a power which, a generation later,
made the bankers of Tuscany dukes of Athens. The Greeks, had they
been united, might have recovered the whole peninsula amidst this
state of confusion. But the sketch which the imperial historian, John
Cantacuzene, has left us of the <i>archontes</i> of the Morea shows that they
were quite as much divided among themselves as the turbulent Frank
vassals of the shadowy Prince of Achaia. “Neither good nor evil
fortune,” he wrote, “nor time, that universal solvent, can dissolve
their mutual hatred, which not only endures all their lives, but is
transmitted after death as a heritage to their children<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.”</p>

<p>Cantacuzene, however, took a step which ultimately led to the
recapture of the Morea, when he abolished the system of sending a
subordinate Byzantine official to Mistra, and appointed his second son,
Manuel, with the title of Despot, as governor of the Byzantine province
for life. The Despot of Mistra at once made his presence felt. He
drove off the Turkish corsairs, who had begun to infest the deep bays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
and jagged coast-line of the peninsula, levied ship-money for its defence
against pirates, and, when his Greek subjects objected to be taxed
for their own benefit, crushed rebellion by means of his Albanian
bodyguard. Now, for the first time, we hear of that remarkable race,
whose origin is as baffling to ethnologists as is their future to diplomatists,
in the history of the Morea, where hereafter they were destined
to play so distinguished a part. It is to the policy of Manuel Cantacuzene,
who rewarded his faithful Albanians with lands in the south-west
and centre of the country, that modern Greece owes the services
of that valiant race, which fought so vigorously for her independence
and its own in the last century. Manuel’s example was followed by
other Despots; and ere long ten thousand Albanians were colonising
the devastated and deserted lands of the Peloponnese.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the barren honour of Prince of Achaia had passed from
one absentee to another. John of Gravina, who had been installed in
the room of the last unhappy Villehardouin princess, grew disgusted
with the sorry task of trying to restore order, and transferred his
rights to Catherine of Valois, widow of his brother, Philip of Taranto;
her son Robert, who was both suzerain and sovereign of the principality,
was a mere phantom ruler whom the Achaian barons treated with contempt.
After his death they offered the empty title of princess to Queen
Joanna I of Naples on condition that she did not interfere with their fiefs
and their feuds. Then a new set of conquerors descended upon the distracted
country, and began the last chapter of Frankish rule in Achaia.</p>

<p>The great exploit of the Catalans in carving out for themselves a
duchy bearing the august name of Athens had struck the imagination
of Southern Europe. Towards the close of the fourteenth century a
similar, but less famous band of freebooters, the Navarrese Company,
repeated in Achaia what the Catalans, seventy years earlier, had
achieved in Attica and Bœotia. Conquering nominally in the name
of Jacques de Baux, a scion of the house of Taranto, but really for
their own hands, the soldiers of Navarre rapidly occupied one place
after another. Androusa, in Messenia, at that time the capital of the
Frankish principality, fell before them; and at “sandy Pylos,” the
home of Nestor, then called Zonklon, they made such a mark that
the spot was believed by Hopf to have derived its name of Navarino
from the castle which they held there. In 1386 their captain, Pedro
Bordo de San Superan, styled himself Vicar of the principality, a title
which developed into that of prince.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another Western Power, and that the most cunning
and persistent, had taken advantage of these troublous times to gain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
a footing in the Peloponnese. Venice, true to her cautious commercial
policy, had long been content with the two Messenian stations of Modon
and Koron, and had even refused a tempting offer of some desperate
barons to hand over to her the whole of Achaia. During the almost
constant disturbances which had distracted the rest of the peninsula
since the death of Guillaume de Villehardouin, the two Venetian ports
had enjoyed comparative peace and prosperity. The high tariffs which
the Frankish princes had erected round their own havens had driven
trade to these Venetian harbours, so conveniently situated for trade
with the great Venetian island of Crete as well. The documents which
Sathas has published from the Venetian archives are full of allusions
to these two now almost forgotten places. But at last, towards the end
of the fourteenth century, Venice resolved on expansion. She accordingly
bought Argos and Nauplia, the old fiefs which the first French Lord
of Athens had received from the first of the Villehardouins, and which
lingered on in the hands of the representatives of the fallen Athenian
duke. A little later Lepanto, the old Naupaktos, gave the Venetians
a post on the Corinthian Gulf.</p>

<p>As the Byzantine Empire dwindled before the incursions of the
Turks, the Greek province of Mistra assumed more importance in the
eyes of the statesmen at Constantinople. In 1415 the Emperor Manuel
II, with an energy which modern sovereigns of Greece would do well
to imitate, resolved to see for himself how matters stood, and arrived
in the Morea. He at once set to work to re-erect the six-mile rampart,
or “Hexamilion,” across the Isthmus, which had been fortified by
Xerxes, Valerian, Justinian, and, in recent times, by the last Despot
of Mistra, Theodore I Palaiologos. Manuel’s wall followed the course
of Justinian’s; and, in the incredibly short space of twenty-five days,
forced labourers, working under the imperial eye, had erected a rampart
strengthened by no less than 153 towers.</p>

<p>But the Emperor saw that it was necessary to reform the Morea
from within as well as to fortify it without. We have from the pen of
a Byzantine satirist, Mazaris, who has written a <i>Dialogue of the Dead</i>
in the manner of Lucian, a curious, if somewhat highly-coloured
account of the Moreotes as they were, or at any rate seemed to him to
be, at this time<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. In the Peloponnese, he tells us, are “Lacedæmonians,
Italians, Peloponnesians (Greeks), Slavonians, Illyrians (Albanians),
Egyptians (gypsies), and Jews, and among them are not a few half-castes.”
He says that the Lakonians, who “are now called Tzakones,”
have “become barbarians” in their language, of which he gives some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
specimens. He goes on to make the shrewd remark, true to-day of
all Eastern countries where the Oriental assumes a veneer of Western
civilisation, that “each race takes the worst features of the others,”
the Greeks assimilating the turbulence of the Franks, and the Franks
the cunning of the Greeks. So insecure was life and property that arms
were worn night and day—a practice obsolete in the time of Thucydides.
Of the Moreote <i>archontes</i> he has nothing good to say; they are “men
who ever delight in battles and disturbances, who are for ever breathing
murder, who are full of deceit and craft, barbarous and pig-headed,
unstable and perjured, faithless to both Emperor and Despots.” Yet
a Venetian report—and the Venetians were keen observers—sent to
the government a few years later, depicts the Morea as a valuable
asset. It contained, writes the Venetian commissioner, 150 strong
castles; the soil is rich in minerals; and it produces silk, honey, wax,
corn, raisins, and poultry.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of alarms an eminent philosopher—to the surprise
of the elegant Byzantines, it is true—had fixed his seat at Mistra.
George Gemistos Plethon believed that he had found in Plato a cure
for the evils of the Morea. Centuries before the late Mr Henry George,
he advocated a single tax. An advanced fiscal reformer, he suggested
a high tariff for all articles which could be produced at home; a paper
strategist, he had a scheme which he submitted, together with his
other proposals, to the Emperor, for creating a standing army; an anti-clerical,
he urged that the monks should work for their living, or
discharge public functions without pay. The philosopher, in tendering
this advice to the Emperor, modestly offered his own services for the
purpose of carrying it out. Manuel II was a practical statesman, who
knew that he was living, as Cicero would have said, “non in Platonis
republica, sed in fæce Lycurgi.” The offer was rejected.</p>

<p>At last the long threatened Turkish peril, temporarily delayed by
the career of Timour and the great Turkish defeat at Angora, was at
hand. The famous Ottoman commander, Evrenos Beg, had already
twice entered the peninsula, once as the ally of the Navarrese prince
against the Greek Despot, once as the foe of both. In 1423 a still
greater captain, Turakhan, easily scaled the Hexamilion, leaving
behind him at Gardiki, as a memorial of his invasion, a pyramid of
eight hundred Albanian skulls. But, by the irony of history, just before
Greeks and Franks alike succumbed to the all-conquering Turks, the
dream of the Byzantine court was at last realised, and the Frank
principality ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The Greek portion of the Morea was at this time in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the three brothers of the Emperor John VI Palaiologos—Theodore II,
Thomas, and Constantine—the third of whom was destined to die on
the walls of Constantinople as last Emperor of the East. Politic
marriages and force of arms soon extinguished the phantom of Frankish
rule; and the Genoese baron, Centurione Zaccaria, nephew of Bordo
de San Superan, who had succeeded his uncle as last Prince of Achaia,
was glad to purchase peace by giving his daughter’s hand to Thomas
Palaiologos with the remaining fragments of the once famous principality,
except the family barony and the princely title, as her dowry. Thus,
when Centurione died in 1432, save for the six Venetian stations, the
whole peninsula was once more Greek. Unhappily, the union between
the three brothers ended with the disappearance of the common enemy.
Both Theodore and Constantine were ambitious of the imperial diadem;
and, while the former was pressing his claims at Constantinople, the
latter was besieging Mistra, having first sent the historian Phrantzes,
his confidential agent in these dubious transactions, to obtain the
Sultan’s consent. Assisted by his brother Thomas and a force of
Frank mercenaries, Constantine was only induced to keep the peace
by the intervention of the Emperor; till, in 1443, Theodore removed
this source of jealousy by carrying out his long-cherished scheme of
retiring from public life. He accordingly handed over the government
of Mistra to Constantine and received in exchange the city of Selymbria
on the Sea of Marmora, where he afterwards died of the plague.</p>

<p>The Morea was now partitioned between Constantine, who took
possession of the eastern portion, embracing Lakonia, Argolis, Corinth,
and the southern shore of the Corinthian Gulf as far as Patras, and
Thomas, who governed the western part. With all his faults Constantine
was a man of far greater energy and patriotism than the rest of his
family, and he lost no time in developing a national policy. His first
act was to restore the Hexamilion; his next, to attempt the recovery of
the Athenian duchy from the Acciajuoli family for the Greek cause,
which he personified. Nine years earlier, on the death of Duke Antonio,
he had sent Phrantzes to negotiate for the cession of Athens and Thebes.
Foiled on that occasion, he now invaded the duchy and forced the
weak Duke Nerio II to do homage and pay tribute to him. The Albanians
and Koutso-Wallachs of Thessaly rose in his favour; the Serbs promised
to aid him in defending the Isthmus against the Turks; it seemed for
the moment as if there were at last some hope of a Christian revival
in the Near East. But the battle of Varna soon put an end to these
dreams. Murad II, accompanied by the Duke of Athens, set out in
1446, at the head of a large army, for the Isthmus. The two Despots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
had assembled a considerable force behind the ramparts of the Hexamilion,
which seemed so imposing to the Sultan that he remonstrated
with his old military counsellor, Turakhan, for having advised him to
attack such apparently impregnable lines so late in the season. But
the veteran, who knew his Greeks and had taken the Hexamilion
twenty-three years before, replied that its defenders would not long
resist a determined attack. A Greek officer, who had been sent by
Constantine to reconnoitre the Turkish position, came back so terrified
at the strength of the enemy that he urged his master to retreat at
once to the mountains of the Morea. The Despot ordered his arrest
as a disciplinary measure, but he was so greatly struck by what he
had heard that he sent the Athenian Chalkokondyles, father of the
historian, to offer terms of peace to the Sultan. Murad scornfully
rejected the proposals, arrested the envoy, and demanded, as the
price of his friendship, the destruction of the Hexamilion and the
payment of tribute. This was too much for the high-spirited Despot,
and the conflict began.</p>

<p>For three whole days the excellent Turkish artillery played upon
the walls of the rampart. Then a general assault was ordered, and, after
a brave defence by the two Despots, a young Serbian janissary climbed
to the top of the wall and planted the Turkish flag there in full view
of the rival hosts. The towers on either side of him were soon taken by
his comrades, the gates were forced in, and the Turks streamed through
them into the peninsula. The Greeks fled; the two Despots among them;
Akrocorinth surrendered, and a band of 300, who had thought of
“making a new Thermopylæ” at Kenchreæ, were soon forced to lay
down their arms. Together with 600 other captives, they were beheaded
by the Sultan’s orders. Then the Turkish army was divided into two
sections; one, under old Turakhan, penetrated into the interior; the
other, commanded by the Sultan in person, followed the coast of the
Corinthian Gulf, burning the mediæval town which had arisen on the
ruins of Sikyon. Aigion shared the same fate; but most of the inhabitants
of Patras had escaped over the Gulf before Murad arrived
there. The old Frankish citadel defied all the efforts of the besiegers,
for the besieged knew that they had nothing to hope from surrender.
A breach was made in the walls, but the defenders poured boiling
resin on to the heads of the janissaries and worked at the rampart
till the breach was made good. The season was by this time very far
advanced, so the Sultan and his lieutenant withdrew to Thebes,
dragging with them 60,000 captives, who were sold as slaves. The
Despots were glad to obtain peace and a qualified independence by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
paying a capitation tax, and by sending their envoys to do homage
to the Sultan in his headquarters at Thebes. The Greeks ascribed their
misfortunes to their Albanian and Frankish mercenaries, the former
of whom had begun to feel their power, while the latter had espoused
the cause of Centurione’s illegitimate son at the moment when the
Despots were engaged in the defence of the country.</p>

<p>On the death of the Emperor in 1448 the Despot Constantine succeeded
to the imperial title; and it is a picturesque fact that the last
Emperor of Constantinople was crowned at Mistra, where his wife
still lies buried, near that ancient Sparta which had given so many
heroes to Hellas. His previous government was bestowed on his
youngest brother Demetrios, with the exception of Patras, which was
added to the province of Thomas. The new partition took place in
Constantinople, where the two brothers solemnly swore before God and
their aged mother to love one another and to rule the Morea in perfect
unanimity. But no sooner had they arrived at their respective capitals
of Mistra and Patras than they proceeded to break their oaths. Thomas,
the more enterprising of the two, attacked his brother; Demetrios,
destitute of patriotism, called in the aid of the Turks, who readily
appeared under the leadership of Turakhan, made Thomas disgorge
most of what he had seized, and on the way destroyed what remained
of the Hexamilion. The object of this was soon obvious. As soon as
the new Sultan, Mohammed II, was ready to attack Constantinople,
he ordered Turakhan to keep the two Palaiologoi busy in the Morea,
so that they might not send assistance to their brother the Emperor.
The old Pasha once again marched into the peninsula; but he found
greater resistance than he had expected on the Isthmus. He and
his two sons, Achmet and Omar, then spread their forces over the
country, plundering and burning as they went, till the certainty of
Constantinople’s fall rendered their presence in the Morea no longer
necessary. But as Achmet was retiring through the Pass of Dervenaki,
that death-trap of armies, between Argos and Corinth, the Greeks
fell upon him, routed his men and took him prisoner. Demetrios, either
from gratitude for Turakhan’s recent services to him, or from fear
of the old warrior’s revenge, released his captive without ransom. It
was the last ray of light before the darkness of four centuries descended
upon Greece.</p>

<p>The news that Constantinople had fallen and that the Emperor had
been slain came like a thunderbolt upon his wretched brothers, who
naturally expected that they would be the next victims. But Mohammed
was not in a hurry; he knew that he could annihilate them when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
chose; meanwhile he was content to accept an annual tribute of 12,000
ducats. The folly of the greedy Byzantine officials, who held the chief
posts at the petty courts of Patras and Mistra, had prepared, however, a
new danger for the Despots. The Albanian colonists had multiplied
while the Greek population had diminished; and the recent Turkish
devastations had increased the extent of waste land where they could
pasture their sheep. Fired by the great exploits of their countryman,
Skanderbeg, in Albania, they were seized by one of those rare yearnings
for independence which meet us only occasionally in Albanian history.
The official mind seized this untoward moment to demand a higher
tax from the Albanian lands. The reply of the shepherds was a general
insurrection in which 30,000 Albanians followed the lead of their
chieftain, Peter Boua, “the lame.” Their object was to expel the Greeks
from the peninsula; but this, of course, did not prevent other Greeks,
dissatisfied, for reasons of their own, with the rule of the Despots,
from throwing in their lot with the Albanians. A Cantacuzene gained
the support of the insurgents for his claims on Mistra by taking an
Albanian name; the bastard son of Centurione emerged from prison
and was proclaimed as Prince of Achaia. Both Mistra and Patras were
besieged; and it soon became clear that nothing but Turkish intervention
could save the Morea from becoming an Albanian principality.
Accordingly, the aid of the invincible Turakhan was again solicited;
and, as Mohammed believed in the policy—long followed in Macedonia
by his successors—of keeping the Christian races as evenly balanced
as possible, the Turkish general was sent to suppress the revolt without
utterly destroying the revolted. Turakhan carried out his instructions
with consummate skill. He soon put down the insurgents, but allowed
them to retain their stolen cattle and the waste lands which they had
occupied, on payment of a fixed rent. He then turned to the two
Despots and gave them the excellent advice to live as brothers, to be
lenient to their subjects, and to be vigilant in the prevention of disturbances.
Needless to say, his advice was not taken.</p>

<p>The power of the Palaiologoi was at an end; and the Greek <i>archontes</i>
and Albanian chiefs did not hesitate to put themselves in direct communication
with the Sultan when they wanted the confirmation of
their privileges. But the Despots might, perhaps, have preserved the
forms of authority for the rest of their lives had it not been for the
rashness of Thomas, who seemed to be incapable of learning by experience
that he only existed on sufferance. In 1457, emboldened by the successes
of Skanderbeg, he refused to pay his tribute. Mohammed II
was not the man to submit to an insult of that sort from a petty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
prince whom he could crush whenever he chose. In the spring of the
following year the great Sultan appeared at the Isthmus; but this
time the noble fortress of Akrocorinth held out against him. Leaving a
force behind him to blockade it, he advanced into the interior of the
peninsula, accompanied by the self-styled Albanian leader in the late
revolt, Cantacuzene, whose influence he found useful in treating with
the Arnauts. The Greeks, whom he took, were despatched as colonists
to Constantinople; the Albanians, who had broken their parole, were
punished by the breaking of their wrists and ankles—a horrible scene
long commemorated by the Turkish name of “Tokmak Hissari,” or
“the castle of the ankles.” Mouchli, at that time one of the chief towns
in the Morea, near the classic ruins of Mantinea, offered considerable
resistance; but lack of water forced the defenders to yield, and then the
Sultan returned to Corinth. His powerful cannon soon wrecked the
bakehouse and the magazines of the citadel; provisions fell short; and
the fact was betrayed by the archbishop to the besiegers. At last the
place surrendered, and its gallant commander was deputed by Mohammed
to bear his terms of peace to Thomas. The latter was ordered to cede
the country as far south as Mouchli, and as far west as Patras; this
district was then united with the Pashalik of Thessaly, the governor
of the whole province being Turakhan’s son Omar, who remained with
10,000 soldiers in the Morea. The other Despot, Demetrios, was commanded
to send his daughter to the Sultan’s harem.</p>

<p>Thomas at once complied with his conqueror’s demands; but his
ambition soon revived when Mohammed had gone. Fresh victories of
Skanderbeg suggested to him the flattering idea that a Palaiologos
could do more than a mere Albanian. Divisions among the Turkish
officers in his old dominions increased his confidence—a quality in
which Greeks are not usually lacking. Early in 1459 he raised the
standard of revolt; but, at the same time, committed the folly of
attacking his brother’s possessions. Phrantzes, who, after having been
sold as a slave when Constantinople fell, had obtained his freedom and
had entered the service of Thomas, has stigmatised in forcible language
the wickedness of those evil counsellors who had advised his master
to embark on a civil war and to “eat his oaths as if they were vegetables.”
Most of Thomas’ successes were at the expense of his brother, for, of
all the places lately annexed by the Turks, Kalavryta alone was
recovered. But the Albanians did far more harm to the country than
either the Greeks or the Turkish garrison by plundering both sides
with absolute impartiality and deserting from Thomas to Demetrios,
or from Demetrios to Thomas, on the slightest provocation. Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the Turks attacked Thomas at Leondari, at the invitation of his
brother; and the defeat which he sustained induced the miserable
Despot to go through the form of reconciliation with Demetrios, under
the auspices of Holy Church. This display of brotherly love had the
usual sequel—a new fratricidal war; but Mohammed II had now made
up his mind to put an end to the Palaiologoi, and marched straight
to Mistra. Demetrios soon surrendered, and humbly appeared in the
presence of his master. The Sultan insisted upon the prompt performance
of his former command, that the Despot’s daughter should
enter the seraglio, and told him that Mistra could no longer be his.
He therefore ordered him to bid his subjects surrender all their cities
and fortresses—an order which was at once executed, except at
Monemvasia. That splendid citadel, which had so long defied the
Franks at the zenith of their power, and boasted of the special protection
of Providence, now scorned to surrender to the infidel. The
daughter of Demetrios, who had been sent thither for safety, was,
indeed, handed over to the Turkish envoys, and Demetrios himself
was conducted to Constantinople; but the Monemvasiotes proclaimed
Thomas as their liege lord, and he shortly afterwards presented
Monemvasia to the Pope, who appointed a governor.</p>

<p>Having thus wiped the province of Demetrios from the map,
Mohammed turned his arms against Thomas. Wherever a city resisted,
its defenders were punished without mercy and in violation of the most
solemn pledges. The Albanian chiefs who had defied the Sultan at
Kastritza were sawn asunder; the Albanian captain of Kalavryta was
flayed alive; Gardiki was once more the scene of a terrible massacre,
ten times worse than that which had disgraced Turakhan thirty-seven
years before. These acts of cruelty excited very different feelings in
the population. Some, especially the Albanians, were inspired to fight
with the courage of despair; others preferred slavery to an heroic
death. From the neighbourhood of Navarino alone 10,000 persons
were dragged away to colonise Constantinople; and a third of the Greeks
of Greveno, which had dared to resist, were carried off as slaves. The
castles of Glarentza and Santameri were surrendered by the descendants
of Guillaume de Villehardouin’s Turks, who experienced, like the
Albanians, the faithless conduct of their conquerors. Meanwhile Thomas
had fled to Navarino, and, on the day when the Sultan reached that
place, set sail with his wife and family from a neighbouring harbour
for Corfù. There the faithful Phrantzes joined him and wrote his history
of these events—the swan-song of free Greece.</p>

<p>Another Palaiologos, however, Graitzas by name, showed a heroism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
of which the Despot was incapable. This man, the last defender of his
country, held out in the castle of Salmenikon between Patras and Aigion
till the following year, and, when the town was taken, still defied all
the efforts of the Turks, who allowed him to withdraw, with all the
honours of war, into Venetian territory at Lepanto. In the autumn of
1460 Mohammed left the Morea, after having appointed Zagan Pasha
as military governor, with orders to install the new Turkish authorities
and to make arrangements for the collection of the capitation tax and
of the tribute of children. Thus the Morea fell under Turkish rule,
which thenceforward continued for an almost unbroken period of three
hundred and fifty years. Save at Monemvasia, where the papal flag
still waved, and at Nauplia, Argos, Thermisi, Koron, Modon, and
Navarino, where Venice still retained her colonies, there was none to
dispute the Sultan’s sway.</p>

<p>The fate of the Palaiologoi deserves a brief notice. Demetrios lived
ten years at Ænos in Thrace in the enjoyment of the pension which
Mohammed allowed him, and died a monk at Adrianople in 1470.
His daughter, whom the Sultan never married after all, had predeceased
him. Thomas proceeded to Rome with the head of St Andrew from
Patras as a present for the Pope, who received the precious relic with
much ceremony at the spot near the Ponte Molle, where the little
chapel of St Andrew now commemorates the event, and assigned to
its bearer a pension of 300 ducats a month, to which the cardinals
added 200 more, and Venice a smaller sum. He died at Rome in 1465,
leaving two sons and two daughters. One of the latter died in a convent
on the island of Santa Maura; the other married, first a Caracciolo of
Naples and then the Grand Duke Ivan III of Russia, by whom she
had a daughter, afterwards the wife of Alexander Jagellon of Poland.
With this daughter the female line became extinct. Of Thomas’ two
sons, the elder, Andrew, married a woman off the streets of Rome,
ceded all his rights, first to Charles VIII of France, and then to
Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, and died in 1502 without issue. The
younger son, Manuel, escaped from papal tutelage to the court of
Mohammed II, who gave him an establishment and allowed him a
daily sum for its maintenance. He died a Christian; but of his two
sons (the elder of whom died young), the younger became a Mussulman,
took the name of Mohammed, and is last heard of in the reign of Suleiman
the Magnificent. Though the family would thus appear to have
long been extinct, a Cornish antiquary announced in 1815 that the
church of Landulph contained a monument to one of Thomas’ descendants.
A few years ago a lady residing in London considered herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
to be the heiress of the Palaiologoi and aspired to play a part in the
Eastern question<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. But neither of these claims is genealogically sound;
for there is no historical proof of the existence of the supposed third
son of Thomas, mentioned in the Landulph inscription. But, after all,
the world has not lost much by the extinction of this race, nor would
the future of Constantinople or Greece be affected by its revival.</p>

<h4 id="heading4">APPENDIX<br />
THE NAME OF NAVARINO</h4>

<p>Ever since Hopf published his history of mediæval Greece writers
on that subject have followed his opinion that the name of Navarino
was derived from the Navarrese Company, which entered the Morea in
1381 to support the claims of Jacques de Baux, titular emperor of
Constantinople and prince of Achaia, and which established its headquarters
at the classic Pylos. Hopf adduces no evidence in support
of this derivation, which he thrice repeats<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, except that of the French
traveller De Caumont, who saw at Pylos in 1418 <i>ung chasteau hault sur
une montaigne que se nomme chasteau Navarres</i><a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. But his opinion,
mainly formed in order to controvert the anti-Hellenic theory of
Fallmerayer, has been followed, also without proof, by Hertzberg<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>,
Tozer<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, and more tentatively by Paparregopoulos<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The name of
Navarino, however, seems to have existed long before the Navarrese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Company ever set foot in Greece. Nearly a century earlier a golden
bull<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of the Emperor Andronikos II, dated 1293, confirmed the possessions
of the church of Monemvasia, among which it specially mentions
τὴν Πύλον, τὸν καλούμενον Ἀβαρῖνον. A little before the date of this
imperial document (1287-1289) Nicholas II de Saint-Omer, lord of half
Thebes, was bailie of the principality of Achaia for Charles II of Naples,
and the Greek <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i><a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> tells us that ἔχτισεν τὸ κάστρον
τοῦ Ἀβαρίνου. Now Hopf himself thought that the French version of
the <i>Chronicle, Le Livre de la Conqueste</i><a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> (in which the above passage runs
<i>ferma le chastel de port de Junch</i>), was the original of the four editions
which we possess. It is generally agreed that the French version was
written between 1333 and 1341; but it is by no means certain that the
French is the original and the Greek a translation; rather would it
appear that the Greek was the original, in which case it was composed
in the early part of the fourteenth century, for the one passage<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which
refers to an event as late as 1388 is regarded as an interpolation by
the latest editor of the <i>Chronicle</i>, Dr Schmitt. Even the most recent
of all the four versions—the Aragonese—was written, as it expressly
says<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, no later than 1393. Therefore we have every reason for regarding
the mention of the name Ἀβαρῖνος in the Greek <i>Chronicle</i> as a second
proof that it was in common use long before the time of the Navarrese<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>There are several other passages in which the name occurs, the
date of which cannot, however, be fixed with certainty. In the <i>Synekdemos</i>
of Hierokles<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> we have three times the phrase Πύλος, ἡ πατρὶς
Νέστορος, νῦν δὲ καλεῖται Ἀβαρῖνος. Now Hierokles wrote before
535, but all these three passages occur in the lists of towns which have
changed their names, and these three lists must belong, as Krumbacher
points out, to a much later period than the main body of the work.
The scholiast to Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> also makes an annotation Πύλος ὀ καὶ
Ἀβαρῖνος, and in the Latin manuscripts of that passage the rendering
is <i>Pylus, qui et Abarmus</i> (sic).</p>

<p>The alteration of Abarinos into Navarino follows, of course, the
usual Greek habit of prefixing to the mediæval name the last letter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of the accusative of the article. Thus εἰς τὸν Ἀβαρῖνον becomes
Ναβαρῖνον, just as εἰς τὴν Πόλιν becomes <i>Stambûl</i>, εἰς τὰς Ἀθῆνας
<i>Satines</i> or <i>Sathines</i>, εἰς τὰς Θῆβας <i>Estives</i>. The conclusion seems to
be that Fallmerayer was right after all when he derived the name of
Navarino from a settlement of Avars on the site of the ancient Pylos<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.
The settlement of the Navarrese Company there was merely a coincidence.</p>

<p>It may be added that <i>Abarinus</i> also occurs in a document<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> of
Charles I of Naples, dated 1280, as the name of a place in Apulia, not
apparently Bari.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since I wrote the above note on this subject I have found two other
passages which confirm the view that the name of Navarino existed
before the Navarrese Company entered Greece. They occur in the
<i>Commemoriali</i><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, where we find Venice complaining to Robert, prince
of Achaia, and to the bailie of Achaia and Lepanto that the crew of
a Genoese ship had started from <i>Navarrino vecchio</i> and had plundered
some Venetian subjects. The dates of these two documents are 1355
and 1356. The late Professor Krumbacher, in the <i>Byzantinische
Zeitschrift</i> (<span class="allsmcap">XIV.</span> 675), agreed that Hopf’s derivation had been disproved
by my article, but thought that the name of Navarino comes not from
the Avars, but from the Slavonic <i>javorina</i>, “a wood of maples.”</p>

<h3 id="heading5">4. THE DUKES OF ATHENS</h3>

<p>Nations, like individuals, sometimes have the romance of their lives
in middle age—a romance unknown, perhaps, to the outside world
until, long years afterwards, some forgotten bundle of letters throws a
flash of rosy light upon a period hitherto regarded as uneventful and
commonplace. So is it with the history of Athens under the Frankish
domination, which Finlay first described in his great work. But since
his day numerous documents have been published, and still more are in
course of publication, which complete the picture of mediæval Athens as
he drew it in a few master-strokes. Barcelona and Palermo have been
ransacked for information; the Venetian archives have yielded a rich
harvest; Milan has contributed her share; and a curious collection of
Athenian legends has been made by an industrious and patriotic Greek.
We know now, as we never knew before, the strange story of the classic
city under her French, her Catalan, and her Florentine masters; and it is
high time that the results of these researches should be laid before the
British public. The present paper deals with the first two of these three
periods.</p>

<p>The history of Frankish Athens begins with the Fourth Crusade. By
the deed of partition, which divided up the Byzantine Empire among
the Latin conquerors of Constantinople, the crusading army, whose
chief was Boniface, Marquess of Montferrat, had received “the district
of Athens with the territory of Megara<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>”; and both Attica and Bœotia
were included in that short-lived realm of Salonika, of which he assumed
the title of king. Among the trusty followers who accompanied Boniface
in his triumphal progress across his new dominions was Othon de la Roche,
son of a Burgundian noble, who had rendered him a valuable service by
assisting to settle the serious dispute between him and the first Latin
Emperor of Constantinople, and who afterwards negotiated the marriage
between his daughter and the Emperor Baldwin I’s brother and
successor. This was the man upon whom the King of Salonika, in 1205,
bestowed the most famous city of the ancient world. Thus, in the words
of an astonished chronicler from the West, “Othon de la Roche, son of
a certain Burgundian noble, became, as by a miracle, Duke of the
Athenians and Thebans<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.”</p>

<p>The chronicler was only wrong in the title which he attributed to the
lucky Frenchman, who had succeeded by an extraordinary stroke of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
fortune to the past glories of the heroes and sages of Athens. Othon
modestly styled himself “Sire d’Athènes” or “Dominus Athenarum,”
which his Greek subjects magnified into the “Great Lord” (Μέγας Κύρ
or Μέγας Κύρης), and Dante, in the <i>Purgatorio</i>, transferred by a poetic
anachronism to Peisistratos. Contemporary accounts make no mention
of any resistance to Othon de la Roche on the part of the Greeks, nor was
such likely; for the eminent man, Michael Akominatos, who was then
Metropolitan of Athens, was fully aware that the Akropolis could not
long resist a Western army. Later Venetian writers, however, actuated
perhaps by patriotic bias, propagated a story that the Athenians sent
an embassy offering their city to Venice, but that their scheme was
frustrated, “not without bloodshed, by the men of Champagne under
the Lord de la Roche<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.” If so, it was the sole effort which the Greeks of
Attica made during the whole century of French domination.</p>

<p>Othon’s dominions were large, if measured by the small standard of
classical Greece. The Burgundian state of Athens embraced Attica,
Bœotia, Megaris, and the ancient Opuntian Lokris to the north; while
to the south of the isthmus the “Great Lord’s” deputies governed the
important strongholds of Argos and Nauplia, conferred upon him, in
1212, by Prince Geoffroy I of Achaia as the reward of his assistance in
capturing them, and thenceforth held by Othon and his successors for a
century as fiefs of the Principality. The Italian Marquess of Boudonitza
on the north, the Lord of Salona on the west, were the neighbours, and
the latter subsequently the vassal, of the ruler of Athens, his bulwarks
against the expanding power of the Greek despots of Epeiros. Thus
situated, mediæval Athens had at least four ports—Livadostro, or
Rive d’Ostre, as the Franks called it, on the Gulf of Corinth, where Othon’s
relatives landed when they arrived from France; the harbour of Atalante
opposite Eubœa; the beautiful bay of Nauplia; and the famous Piræus,
known in the Frankish times by the name of Porto Leone from the huge
lion, now in front of the Arsenal at Venice, which then guarded the
entrance to the haven of Themistokles. It is strange, in these circumstances,
that the Burgundian rulers of Athens made little or no attempt
to create a navy, especially as Latin pirates infested the coast of Attica,
and a sail down the Corinthian Gulf was described as “a voyage to
Acheron<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.”</p>

<p>Guiltless of a classical education, and unmoved by the genius of the
place, Othon abstained from seeking a model for the constitution of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
new state in the laws of Solon. Like the other Frankish princes of the
Levant, he adopted the “Book of the Customs of the Empire of Romania,”
a code of usages based on the famous “Assizes of Jerusalem.” But the
feudal society which was thus installed in Attica was very different from
that which existed in the Principality of Achaia or in the Duchy of the
Archipelago. The “Great Lord” of Athens had, at the most, only one
exalted noble, the head of the famous Flemish house of St Omer, near
his throne. It is obvious, from the silence of all the authorities, that the
Burgundians who settled in Othon’s Greek dominions were men of inferior
social position to himself, a fact further demonstrated by the comparative
lack in Attica and Bœotia of those baronial castles so common
in the Peloponnese.</p>

<p>In one respect the Court of Athens, under Othon de la Roche, must
have resembled the Court of the late King George, namely, that there
was no one, except the members of his own family, with whom the ruler
could associate on equal terms. But, as in Georgian, so in Frankish
Athens, the family of the sovereign was numerous enough to form a
society of its own. Not only did Othon marry a Burgundian heiress, by
whom he had two sons, but the news of his astounding good fortune
attracted to the new El Dorado in Greece various members of his clan
from their home in Burgundy. They doubtless received their share of
the good things which had fallen to their lucky relative; a favourite
nephew, Guy, divided with his uncle the lordship of Thebes; a more
distant relative became commander of the castle of Athens. Both
places became the residences of Latin archbishops; and in the room of
Michael Akominatos, in the magnificent church of “Our Lady of Athens,”
as the Parthenon was now called, a Frenchman named Bérard, perhaps
Othon’s chaplain, inaugurated the long series of the Catholic prelates of
that ancient see. The last Greek Metropolitan retired sorrowfully from
his plundered cathedral to the island of Keos, whence he could still see
the shores of his beloved Attica; and for well-nigh two centuries his
titular successors never once visited their confiscated diocese. The Greek
priests who remained behind performed their services in the church near
the Roman market, which was converted into a mosque at the time of
the Turkish conquest, and has now been degraded to a military bakery;
while Innocent III assigned to the Catholic archbishop the ancient
jurisdiction of the Orthodox Metropolitan over his eleven suffragans,
and confirmed to the Church of Athens its possessions at Phyle and
Marathon—places still called by their classical names.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The renewal of the divine grace (wrote the enthusiastic Pope to Bérard)
suffereth not the ancient glory of the city of Athens to grow old. The citadel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
of most famous Pallas hath been humbled to become the seat of the most
glorious Mother of God. Well may we call this city “Kirjath-sepher,” which
when Othniel had subdued to the rule of Caleb, “he gave him Achsah, his
daughter to wife<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.”</p>

</div>

<p>But the “Othniel” of Athens, to whom the Pope had made a punning
allusion, was, like the other Frankish rulers of his time, a sore trial to
the Holy See. He forbade his subjects to give or bequeath their possessions
to the Church, levied dues from the clergy, and showed no
desire to pay tithes or compel his people to pay them. A “concordat”
between Church and State was at last drawn up in 1210, at a Parliament
convened by the Latin Emperor Henry in the valley of Ravenika, near
Lamia, and attended by Othon and all the chief feudal lords of continental
Greece. By this it was agreed that the clergy of both dominations
should pay the old Byzantine land-tax to the temporal authorities, but
that, in return, all churches, monasteries, and other ecclesiastical
property, should be entrusted to the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople
free of all feudal services.</p>

<p>Othon was more loyal to the Empire than to the Papacy. When the
Lombard nobles of Salonika, on the death of Boniface, tried to shake off
the feudal tie which bound that kingdom to the Latin Emperor, he stood
by the latter, even though his loyalty cost him the temporary loss of his
capital of Thebes. He was rewarded by a visit which the Emperor Henry
paid him at Athens, where no Imperial traveller had set foot since Basil
“the Bulgar-slayer,” two centuries earlier, had offered up prayer and
thanksgivings in the greatest of all cathedrals. Like Basil, Henry also
prayed “in the Minster of Athens, which men call Our Lady,” and
received from his host “every honour in his power<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.” Only once again
did an emperor of Constantinople bow down in the Parthenon; and then
it was not as a conqueror but as a fugitive that he came.</p>

<p>The “Great Lord” was not fired with the romance of reigning over
the city of Perikles and Plato. When old age crept on, he felt, like many
another baron of the conquest, that he would like to spend the evening
of his days in his native land; and in 1225 he departed for Burgundy
with his wife and sons, leaving his nephew, Guy, to succeed him in
Greece. Under the wise rule of his successor, the Athenian state prospered
exceedingly. Thebes, where Guy and his connections, the great family
of St Omer, resided, had recovered much of its fame as the seat of the
silk manufactory. Jews and Genoese both possessed colonies there; and
the shrewd Ligurian traders negotiated a commercial treaty with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
new ruler which allowed them to have their own consul, their own court
of justice, and their own buildings both there and at Athens.</p>

<p>The Greeks too profited by the enlightened policy of their sovereign.
One Greek monk at this time made the road to the monastery of St John
the Hunter on the slopes of Hymettos, to which the still standing column
on the way to Marathon alludes; another built one of the two churches at
the quaint little monastery of Our Lady of the Glen, not far from the
fort of Phyle. For thirty years Athens enjoyed profound peace, till a
fratricidal war between Guillaume de Villehardouin, the ambitious Prince
of Achaia, and the great barons of Eubœa involved Guy in their quarrel.
The prince summoned Guy, his vassal for Argos and Nauplia, to assist
him against his foes; Guy, though bound not only by this feudal tie
but by his marriage to one of William’s nieces, refused his aid, and did all
he could to help the enemies of the prince. The latter replied by invading
the dominions of his nephew. Forcing the Kakè Skála, that
narrow and ill-famed road which leads along the rocky coast of the
Saronic Gulf towards Megara, he met Guy’s army at the pass of Mount
Karydi, “the walnut mountain,” on the way to Thebes. There Frankish
Athens and Frankish Sparta first met face to face; the Sire of Athens
was routed and fled to Thebes, where he obtained peace by a promise to
appear before the High Court of Achaia and perform any penalty which
it might inflict upon him for having borne arms against the Prince.</p>

<p>The High Court met at Nikli near Tegea; and the Sire of Athens,
escorted by all his chivalry, made a brave show before the assembled
barons. They were so much impressed by the spectacle that they
declared they could not judge so great a man, and referred the decision
to St Louis of France, the natural protector of the French nobles of
Greece. The chivalrous monarch propounded the question to the
<i>parlement</i> at Paris, which decided that Guy was technically guilty, but
that the trouble and cost of his long journey to France was ample
punishment for his offence. Louis IX, anxious to show him some mark
of royal favour, conferred upon him, at his special request, the title of
Duke of Athens, for which, he told the king, there was an ancient
precedent. The ducal style borne by Guy and his successors has become
famous in literature as well as in history. Dante, Boccaccio, Chaucer,
and Shakespeare bestowed it upon Theseus, and the Catalan chronicler,
Muntaner, upon Menelaos.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wheel of fortune had avenged the Duke of Athens.
His victorious enemy, involved in a quarrel between the rival Greek
states of Nice and Epeiros, had been taken prisoner by the Greek
Emperor; and the flower of the Achaian chivalry was either dead or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
languishing in the dungeons of Lampsakos. In these circumstances the
survivors offered to Guy the regency of Achaia—a post which he
triumphantly accepted. But he had not been long in Greece when
another blow descended upon the Franks. The Latin Empire of
Constantinople fell; and the Emperor Baldwin II, a landless exile, was
glad to accept the hospitality of the Theban Kadmeia and the Castle
of Athens. Thus, on that venerable rock, was played the last pitiful scene
in the brief Imperial drama of the Latin Orient<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>Fired by the reconquest of Constantinople, Michael VIII now
meditated the recovery of the Peloponnese, and demanded the cession
of the three strongest castles in the peninsula as the price of his prisoner’s
freedom. It was Guy’s duty, as regent of Achaia, to convene the High
Court of the Principality to consider this momentous question. The parliament,
almost exclusively composed of ladies—for all the men of mark
had been slain or were in prison—decided, against Guy’s better judgment,
in favour of accepting the Emperor’s terms; and Guy, whose position
was one of great delicacy, finally yielded. Not long afterwards, the first
Duke of Athens died, conscious of having heaped coals of fire upon the
head of his enemy, and proud of leaving to his elder son, John, a state
more prosperous than any other in Greece.</p>

<p>The second Duke, less fortunate than his father, was involved in the
wars against the Greek Emperor, which occupied so much of that period.
The restless scion of the house of Angelos, who had carved out for
himself a principality in the ancient realm of Achilles in Phthiotis, and
reigned over Wallachs and Greeks at Neopatras, or La Patre, beneath
the rocky walls of Mount Œta, fled as a suppliant to the Theban Court
and offered the duke the hand of his daughter Helene if he would only
assist him against the Palaiologoi. The duke, gouty and an invalid,
declined matrimony, but promised his aid. At the head of a picked body
of Athenian knights he easily routed the vastly superior numbers of the
Imperial army, which he contemptuously summed up in a phrase,
borrowed from Herodotos, as “many people, but few men.” As his
reward he obtained for his younger brother William the fair Helene as a
bride; and her dowry, which included the important town of Lamia,
extended the influence of the Athenian duchy as far north as Thessaly.
But John of Athens was destined to experience, like William of Achaia,
the most varied changes of fortune. Wounded in a fight with the Greeks
and their Catalan allies outside the walls of Negroponte, he fell from his
horse and was carried off a prisoner to Constantinople. Michael VIII did
not, however, treat the Duke of Athens as he had treated the Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Achaia. He made no demand for Athenian territory, but contented
himself with a ransom of some £13,500. Policy, rather than generosity,
was the cause of this apparent inconsistency. Fears of an attack by
Charles of Anjou, alarm at the restless ambition of his prisoner’s kinsman,
the Duke of Neopatras, and suspicion of the orthodox clerical party
in his own capital, which regarded him as a schismatic because of his
overtures to Rome, convinced him that the policy of 1262 would not
suit the altered conditions of 1279. He even offered his daughter in
marriage to his prisoner, but the latter refused the Imperial alliance. A
year later John died, and William his brother reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>During the seven years of his reign William de la Roche was the
leading figure in Frankish Greece. Acknowledging the suzerainty of the
Angevin kings of Naples, who had become overlords of Achaia by the
treaty of Viterbo, he was appointed their viceroy in that principality,
and in that capacity built the castle of Dematra, the site of which may
be perhaps found at Kastri, between Tripolitsa and Sparta. Possessed
of ample means, he spent his money liberally for the defence of Frankish
Greece, alike in the Peloponnese and in Eubœa; and great was the grief
of all men when his valiant career was cut short. Now, for the first time
since the conquest, Athens was governed by a Greek, for Guy’s mother,
Helene Angela of Neopatras, who has given her title to K. Rhanghaves’
drama, <i>The Duchess of Athens</i>, acted as regent for her infant son,
Guy, until a second marriage with her late husband’s brother-in-law,
Hugh de Brienne, provided him with a more powerful guardian. The
family of Brienne was one of the most famous of that day. First heard
of in Champagne during the reign of Hugh Capet, it had, in the thirteenth
century, won an Imperial diadem at Constantinople, a royal crown at
Jerusalem, and a count’s coronet at Lecce and at Jaffa; ere long it was
destined to provide the last French Duke of Athens.</p>

<p>The Burgundian duchy of Athens had now reached its zenith; and
the ceremony of Guy II’s coming of age, which has been described for us
in the picturesque Catalan chronicle of Muntaner, affords a striking proof
of the splendour of the ducal Court at Thebes. The young duke had
invited all the great men of his duchy; he had let it be known, too,
throughout the Greek Empire and the Despotat of Epeiros and his
mother’s home of Thessaly, that whosoever came should receive gifts
and favours from his hands, “for he was one of the noblest men in all
Romania who was not a king, and eke one of the richest.” When all the
guests had assembled, Archbishop Nicholas of Thebes celebrated mass
in the Theban minster; and then all eyes were fixed upon the Duke, to
see whom he would ask to confer upon him the order of knighthood—“a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
duty which the King of France, or the Emperor himself, would have
thought it a pleasure and an honour to perform.” What was the surprise
of the brilliant throng when Guy, instead of calling upon such great
nobles as Thomas of Salona or Othon of St Omer, co-owner with himself
of Thebes, called to his side a young Eubœan knight, Boniface of Verona,
lord of but a single castle, which he had sold the better to equip himself
and his retinue. Yet no one made a braver show at the Theban Court;
he always wore the richest clothes, and on the day of the ceremony none
was more elegantly dressed than he, though every one had attired
himself and his <i>jongleurs</i> in the fairest apparel. This was the man whom
the young duke bade dub him a knight, and upon whom, as a reward for
this service, he bestowed the hand of a fair damsel of Eubœa, Agnes de
Cicon, Lady of the classic island of Ægina and of the great Eubœan
castle of Karystos or Castel Rosso, still a picturesque ruin. The duke
gave him also thirteen castles on the mainland and the famous island of
Salamis—sufficient to bring him in a revenue of 50,000 <i>sols</i>.</p>

<p>Prosperous indeed must have been the state whose ruler could afford
such splendid generosity. Worthy too of such a sovereign was the castle
in which he dwelt—the work of the great Theban baron, Nicholas II de
St Omer, who had built it out of the vast wealth of his wife, Marie of
Antioch. The castle of St Omer, which was described as “the finest
baronial mansion in all Romania<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>,” contained sufficient rooms for an
emperor and his court; and its walls were decorated with frescoes
illustrating the conquest of the Holy Land by the Franks, in which
the ancestors of its founder had borne a prominent part. Alas! one
stumpy tower, still bearing the name of Santameri, is all that now
remains of this noble residence of the Athenian dukes and the Theban
barons.</p>

<p>French influence now spread from Thebes over the great plain of
Thessaly to the slopes of Olympos. The Duke of Neopatras died, leaving
his nephew of Athens guardian of his infant son and regent of his
dominions, threatened alike by the Greek Emperor, Andronikos II, and
by the able and ambitious Lady of Epeiros. At Lamia, the fortress which
had been part of his mother’s dowry, Guy received the homage of the
Thessalian baronage, and appointed as his viceroy Antoine le Flamenc,
a Fleming who had become lord of the Bœotian Karditza (where a Greek
inscription on the church of St George still commemorates him as its
“most pious” founder), and who is described as “the wisest man in all
the duchy.” The Greek nobles of Thessaly learnt the French language;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
coins with Latin inscriptions were issued in the name of Guy’s young
ward from the mint of Neopatras<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>; and the condition of Thessaly was
accurately depicted in that curious story the <i>Romance of Achilles</i>, in
which the Greek hero marries a French damsel and the introduction of
French customs is allegorically represented by cutting the child’s hair in
Frankish fashion<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>Wherever there was knightly work to be done, the gallant Duke of
Athens was foremost; none was more impetuous than he at the great
tournament held on the Isthmus of Corinth in 1305, at which the whole
chivalry of Frankish Greece was present. He needs must challenge
Master Bouchart, one of the best jousters of the West, to single combat
with the lance; and their horses met with such force that the ducal
charger fell and rolled its rider in the dust. His Theban castle rang with
the songs of minstrels; festival after festival followed at his Court; and
this prosperity was not merely on the surface. Now for the first time we
find Attica supplying Eubœa with corn, while the gift of silken garments
to Pope Boniface VIII is a proof of the continued manufacture of silk
at Thebes. But the duke’s health was undermined by an incurable
malady; he had no heirs of his body; and, when he died in 1308, there
was already looming on the frontiers of Greece that Grand Company of
Catalan soldiers of fortune whom the weakness of the Emperor, Andronikos
II, had invited from the stricken fields of Sicily to be the terror
and the scourge of the Levant. The last duke of the house of la Roche
was laid to rest in the noble Byzantine abbey of Daphni or Dalfinet (as
the Franks called it), on the Sacred Way between Athens and Eleusis,
which Othon had bestowed upon the Cistercians a century before. Even
to-day there may be seen in the courtyard a sarcophagus, with a cross,
two snakes, and two lilies carved upon it, which the French scholar
Buchon (<i>La Grèce continentale</i>) believed to have been the tomb of “the
good duke,” Guy II.</p>

<p>The succession to the “delectable duchy” of Athens—for such,
indeed, it was in the early years of the fourteenth century—was not
seriously disputed. There were only two claimants, both first cousins of
the late duke—Eschive, Lady of Beyrout, and Walter de Brienne, Count
of Lecce, a true scion of that adventurous family, who had been a
“knight of death” in the Angevin cause in Sicily, and had fought like
the lion on his banner at the fatal battle of Gagliano. The rival claims
having been referred to the High Court of Achaia, of which the Duke of
Athens was, in Angevin times, a peer, the barons decided, as was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
natural, in favour of the gallant and powerful Count of Lecce, more fitted
than a lonely widow to govern a military state. Unfortunately, Duke
Walter of Athens was as rash as he was brave; prison and defeat in
Sicily had not taught him to respect the infantry of Cataluña. Speaking
their language and knowing their ways, he thought that he might use
them for his own ends and then dismiss them when they had served his
purpose.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1309 the Catalan Grand Company threatened by
starvation in Macedonia, marched through the vale of Tempe into the
granary of Greece, whence, a year later, they descended upon Lamia.
The Duke of Neopatras had now come of age, and had not only emancipated
himself from Athenian tutelage, but had formed a triple alliance
with the Greek Emperor and the Greek Despot of Epeiros in order to
prevent the ultimate annexation of his country by his French neighbours.
In these circumstances the new Duke of Athens bethought himself of
employing the wandering Catalans against the allies. Thanks to the good
offices of Roger Deslaur, a knight of Roussillon who was in his employ,
he engaged them at the same high rate of payment which they had
received from Andronikos II. The Catalans at once showed that they
were well worth the money, for by the end of a six months’ campaign
they had captured more than thirty castles for their employer. Thereupon
his three adversaries hastened to make peace with him on his own
terms.</p>

<p>Walter now rashly resolved to rid himself of the expensive mercenaries
for whom he had no further use. He first selected 500 men from
their ranks, gave them their pay and lands on which to settle, and then
abruptly bade the others begone, although at the time he still owed them
four months’ wages. They naturally declined to obey this summary
order, and prepared to conquer or die; for retreat was impossible, and
there was no other land where they could seek their fortune. Walter,
too, assembled all available troops against the common enemies of
Frankish Greece—for as such the savage Catalans were regarded. Never
had a Latin army made such a brave show as that which was drawn up
under his command in the spring of 1311 on the great Bœotian plain,
almost on the self-same spot where, more than sixteen centuries before,
Philip of Macedon had won that “dishonest victory” which destroyed
the freedom of classic Greece, and where, in the time of Sulla, her Roman
masters had thrice met the Pontic troops of Mithridates. All the great
feudatories of Greece rallied to his call. There came Alberto Pallavicini,
Marquess of Boudonitza, who kept the pass of Thermopylæ; Thomas de
Stromoncourt of Salona, who ruled over the slopes of Parnassos, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
whose noble castle still preserves the memory of its mediæval lords;
Boniface of Verona, the favourite of the late Duke of Athens; George
Ghisi, one of the three great barons of Eubœa; and Jean de Maisy,
another powerful magnate of that famous island. From Achaia, and
from the scattered duchy of the Archipelago, contingents arrived to do
battle against the desperate mercenaries of Cataluña. Already Walter
dreamed of not merely routing the company, but of planting his lion
banner on the ramparts of Byzantium.</p>

<p>But the Catalans were better strategists than the impetuous Duke
of Athens. They knew that the strength of the Franks lay in the rush
of their splendid cavalry, and they laid their plans accordingly. The
marshy soil of the Copaic basin afforded them an excellent defence
against a charge of horsemen; and they carefully prepared the ground
by ploughing it up, digging a trench round it, and then irrigating the
whole area by means of canals from the river Kephissos. By the middle
of March, when the two armies met face to face, a treacherous covering
of green grass concealed the quaking bog from the gaze of the Frankish
leaders.</p>

<p>As if he had some presentiment of his coming death, Walter made his
will—a curious document still preserved<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>—and then, on March 15, took
up his stand on the hill called the Thourion, still surmounted by a
mediæval tower, to survey the field. Before the battle began, the 500
favoured Catalans whom he had retained came to him and told him that
they would rather die than fight against their old comrades. The duke
bade them do as they pleased; and their defection added a welcome and
experienced contingent to the enemy’s forces. When they had gone, the
duke, impatient for the fray, placed himself at the head of 200 French
knights with golden spurs and charged with a shout across the plain.
But, when they reached the fatal spot where the grass was greenest,
their horses, heavily weighted with their coats of mail, plunged all
unsuspecting into the treacherous morass. Some rolled over with their
armoured riders in the mire; others, stuck fast in the stiff bog, stood
still, in the picturesque phrase of the Byzantine historian, “like equestrian
statues,” powerless to move. The shouts of “Aragon! Aragon!”
from the Catalans increased the panic of the horses; showers of arrows
hailed upon the helpless Franks; and the Turkish auxiliaries of the
Catalans rushed forward and completed the deadly work. So great was
the slaughter that only four Frankish nobles are known to have survived
that fatal day—Boniface of Verona, Roger Deslaur, the eldest son of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the Duke of Naxos, and Jean de Maisy of Eubœa<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. At one blow the
Catalans had destroyed the noble chivalry of Frankish Greece; and the
men, whose forefathers had marched with Boniface of Montferrat into
Greece a century earlier, lay dead in the fatal Bœotian swamp. Among
them was the Duke of Athens, whose head, severed by a Catalan knife,
was borne, long afterwards, on a funeral galley to Brindisi and buried in
the church of Santa Croce in his Italian county of Lecce.</p>

<p>The Athenian duchy, “the pleasaunce of the Latins,” as Villani<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
quaintly calls it, now lay at the mercy of the Grand Company; for the
Greeks made no resistance to their new masters, and in fact looked upon
the annihilation of the Franks as a welcome relief. We would fain believe
the story of the Aragonese <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i>, that the heroic
widow of the fallen duke, a worthy daughter of a Constable of France,
defended the Akropolis, where she had taken refuge with her little son
Walter, till she saw that there was no hope of succour. But the Byzantine
historian, Nikephoros Gregoras, expressly says that Athens fell without
a struggle, as Thebes had already fallen. Argos and Nauplia alone held
aloft the banner of the Frankish dukes. Thus the Catalans were able,
without opposition, to parcel out among themselves the towns and
castles of the duchy; the widows of the slain became the wives of the
slayers; each soldier received a consort according to his services; and
many a rough warrior thus found himself the husband of some noble
dame in whose veins flowed the bluest blood of France, and “whose
washhand-basin,” in the phrase of Muntaner, “he was not worthy to
bear.”</p>

<p>After nine years’ wandering these vagabonds settled down in the
promised land, which the most extraordinary fate had bestowed upon
them. But they lacked a leader of sufficient social position to preside
over their changed destinies. Finding no such man in their own ranks,
they offered the post to one of their four noble prisoners, Boniface of
Verona, whom Muntaner, his guest at Negroponte, has described as “the
wisest and most courteous nobleman that was ever born.” Both of
these qualities made him disinclined to accept an offer which would have
rendered him an object of suspicion to Venice, his neighbour in Eubœa,
and of loathing to the whole Frankish world. On his refusal the Catalans
turned to Roger Deslaur, whom neither ties of blood nor scruples of
conscience prevented from becoming their leader. As his reward he
received the castle of Salona together with the widow of its fallen lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>But the victors of the Kephissos soon recognised that they needed
some more powerful head than a simple knight of Roussillon, if they were
to hold the duchy against the jealous enemies whom their meteoric
success had alarmed and excited. Their choice naturally fell upon King
Frederick II of Sicily, the master whom they had served in that island
ten years earlier, and who had already shown that he was not unwilling
to profit by their achievements. Accordingly, in 1312, they invited him
to send them one of his children. He gave them as their duke his second
son Manfred, in whose name—as the Duke was still too young to come
himself—he sent, as governor of Athens, Beranger Estañol, a knight of
Ampurias. On his arrival Deslaur laid down his office, and we hear of
him no more.</p>

<p>The Catalan duchy of Athens was now organised as a state, which,
though dependent in name on a Sicilian duke, really enjoyed a large
measure of independence. The duke nominated the two chief officials,
the vicar-general and the marshal, of whom the former, appointed
during good pleasure, was the political, the latter the military, governor
of the duchy. The marshal was always chosen from the ranks of the
Company; and the office was for half a century hereditary in the family
of De Novelles. Each city and district had its own local governor, called
<i>veguer</i>, <i>castellano</i>, or <i>capitán</i>, whose term of office was fixed at three
years, and who was nominated by the duke, by the vicar-general, or by
the local representatives from among the citizens of the community.
The principal towns and villages were represented by persons known as
<i>sindici</i>, and possessed municipal officials and councils, which did not
hesitate to present petitions, signed with the seal of St George by the
chancellor, to the duke whenever they desired the redress of grievances.
On one occasion we find the communities actually electing the vicar-general;
and the dukes frequently wrote to them about affairs of state.
One of their principal subsequent demands was that official posts should
be bestowed upon residents in the duchy, not upon Sicilians.</p>

<p>The feudal system continued to exist, but with far less brilliance than
under the Burgundian dukes. The Catalan conquerors were of common
origin; and, even after seventy years of residence, the roll of noble
families in the whole duchy contained only some sixteen names. The
Company particularly objected to the bestowal of strong fortresses, such
as Livadia, upon private individuals, preferring that they should be
administered by the government officials. The “Customs of Barcelona”
now supplanted the feudal “Assizes of Romania”; the Catalan idiom of
Muntaner took the place of the elegant French which had been spoken
by the Frankish rulers of Greece. Even to their Greek subjects the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Spanish dukes wrote in “the Catalan dialect,” the employment of which,
as we are expressly told, was “according to the custom and usage of
the city of Athens.” Alike by Catalans and French, the Greeks were
treated as an inferior race, excluded, as a general rule, from all civic
rights, forbidden to intermarry with the conquerors, and still deprived
of their higher ecclesiastical functionaries. But there were some notable
exceptions to these harsh disqualifications. The people of Livadia, for
services rendered to the Company, early received the full franchise of
the Conquistadors; towards the end of the Catalan domination we find
Greeks holding such important posts as those of <i>castellano</i> of Salona,
chancellor of Athens, and notary of Livadia; a count of Salona and a
marshal married Greek ladies; and their wives were allowed to retain
their own faith.</p>

<p>Under the rule of Estañol the Catalans not only held their ground
in Attica and Bœotia, but increased the terror of their name among all
their neighbours. In vain the Pope appealed to King James II of Aragon
to drive them out of Attica; in vain he described the late Duke Walter as
a “true athlete of Christ and faithful boxer of the Church”; the king’s
politic reply was to the effect that the Catalans, if they were cruel, were
also Catholics, who would prove a valuable bulwark of Romanism
against the schismatic Greeks of Byzantium<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. The appointment of King
Frederick II’s natural son, Don Alfonso Fadrique (or Frederick), as
“President of the fortunate army of Franks in the Duchy of Athens”
yet further strengthened the position of the Company. The new vicar-general
was a man of much energy and force of character; and during
his thirteen years’ administration the Catalan state attained its zenith.
Practically independent of Sicilian influence—for the nominal Duke
Manfred died in the year of Fadrique’s appointment, and his younger
brother William was likewise a minor—he acquired a stronger hold upon
Attica, and at the same time a pretext for intervention in the affairs
of Eubœa, by his marriage with Marulla, the heiress of Boniface of
Verona, “one of the fairest Christians in the world, the best woman and
the wisest that ever was in that land,” as Muntaner, who knew her,
enthusiastically describes her. With her Fadrique received back, as her
dowry, the thirteen castles which Guy II of Athens had bestowed upon
her father on that memorable day at Thebes.</p>

<p>The growing power of the Catalans under this daring leader, who had
marched across “the black bridge” of Negroponte and had occupied
two of the most important castles of the island, so greatly alarmed the
Venetians that they persuaded King Frederick II of Sicily to curb the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
restless ambition of his bastard son, lest a European coalition should be
formed against the disturber of Greece. Above all else, the Republic
was anxious that a Catalan navy should not be formed at the Piræus;
and it was therefore stipulated, in 1319, that a plank was to be taken out
of the hull of each of the Catalan vessels then lying in “the sea of Athens,”
and that the ships’ tackle was to be taken up to “the Castle of Athens”
and there deposited<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Thus shut out from naval enterprise, Fadrique
now extended his dominions by land. The last Duke of Neopatras had
died in 1318, and the best part of his duchy soon fell into the hands of
the Catalans of Athens, who might claim that they represented the
Burgundian dukes, and were therefore entitled to some voice in the
government of a land which Guy II had once administered. At Neopatras,
the seat of the extinct Greek dynasty of the Angeloi, Fadrique made his
second capital, styling himself “Vicar-General of the duchies of Athens
and Neopatras.” Thenceforth the Sicilian dukes of Athens assumed the
double title which figures on their coins and in their documents; and,
long after the Catalan duchies had passed away, the Kings of Aragon
continued to bear it. This conquest made the Company master of
practically all continental Greece; even the Venetian Marquess of
Boudonitza paid an annual tribute of four horses to the Catalan vicar-general<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.
Still, however, the faithful family of Foucherolles held the two
great fortresses of Argos and Nauplia for the exiled house of Brienne.</p>

<p>Young Walter had now grown up to man’s estate, and it seemed to
him that the time had come to strike a blow for the recovery of his
Athenian heritage. The Angevins of Naples supported him in their own
interest as well as his; Pope John XXII bade the Archbishops of Patras
and Corinth preach a crusade against the “schismatics, sons of perdition,
and pupils of iniquity” who had seized his patrimony; but the subtle
Venetians, who could have contributed more than Angevin aid or papal
thunder to the success of his expedition, had just renewed their truce
with the Catalans. From that moment his attempt was bound to fail.</p>

<p>Walter was, like his father, a rash general, while his opponents had
not forgotten the art of strategy, to which they owed their success. At
first the brilliant band of French knights and Tuscan men-at-arms which
crossed over with him to Epeiros in 1331 carried all before it. But, when
he arrived in the Catalan duchy, he found that the enemy was much too
cautious to give his fine cavalry a chance of displaying its prowess on the
plains of Bœotia. While the Catalans remained behind the walls of their
fortresses, the invaders wasted their energies on the open country. Ere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
long Walter’s small stock of money ran out, and his chances diminished
with it. The Greeks rendered him no assistance. It is true that a correspondent
of the historian Nikephoros Gregoras wrote that they were
“suffering under extreme slavery,” and had “exchanged their ancient
happiness for boorish ways,” while Guillaume Adam said that they were
“worse than serfs”; but either their sufferings were insufficient to make
them desire a change of masters, or their boorishness was such that it
made them indifferent to the advantages of French culture. Early in the
following year Walter took ship for Italy, never to return. Summoned by
the Florentines to command their forces, he became tyrant of their city,
whence he was expelled amidst universal rejoicings eleven years later. His
name and arms may still be seen in the Bargello of Florence. Thirteen
years afterwards he fell fighting, as Constable of France, against the
English at the battle of Poitiers. His sister Isabelle, wife of Walter
d’Enghien, succeeded to his estates and his pretensions; some of her
descendants continued to bear, till 1381, the empty title of Duke of
Athens, while the last fragments of the French duchy—the castles of
Nauplia and Argos—remained in the possession of others of her line till,
in 1388, they were purchased by Venice.</p>

<p>One irreparable loss was inflicted upon Greece by this expedition.
In order to prevent the castle of St Omer at Thebes from falling into his
hands, the Catalans destroyed that noble monument of Frankish rule.
Loudly does the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i> lament over the loss of a building
more closely associated than any other with the past glories of the De la
Roche. At the time of its destruction it belonged to Bartolommeo
Ghisi, Great Constable of Achaia, one of the three great barons of Eubœa,
son-in-law of Fadrique, and a man of literary and historic tastes, for the
French version of the Chronicle, <i>Le Livre de la Conqueste</i>, was originally
found in his Theban castle<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. Had Fadrique still been head of the
Company at the time, he would probably have saved his kinsman’s
home; but for some unexplained reason he was no longer vicar-general,
though he was still in Greece. Possibly, as he paid a visit to Sicily about
this time, he may have been accused at the Sicilian Court of aiming at
independent sovereignty in the duchies—an accusation to which his too
successful career may have lent some colour. Though he never resumed
the leadership of the Catalans he passed the rest of his life in Greece,
where one of his sons was Count of Salona, and another became, later on,
vicar-general of the duchies.</p>

<p>Soon after Walter’s futile expedition the Papacy made its peace with
the “sons of perdition,” who came to be regarded as a possible defence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
against the growing Turkish peril. Unfortunately, when the Catalans
became respectable members of Christendom, they ceased to be formidable.
Occasionally the old Adam broke out, as when the Count of Salona
plied the trade of a pirate with the aid of the “unspeakable” Turk. But
their Thessalian conquests were slipping away from the luxurious and
drunken progeny of the hardy warriors who had smitten the Franks in
the marshes of the Kephissos. Meanwhile, in distant Sicily, the shadowy
Dukes of Athens and Neopatras came and went without ever seeing their
Greek duchies. Duke William died in 1338; and his successors, John and
Frederick of Randazzo, the picturesque town on the slopes of Etna, both
succumbed to the plague a few years later—mere names in the history
of Athens. But in 1355 the new Duke of Athens became also King of
Sicily, under the title of Frederick III; and thus the two duchies, which
had hitherto been the appanage of younger members of the royal family,
were united with the Sicilian crown in the person of its holder.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, as is natural, the archives of Palermo contain far more
frequent allusions to the duchies of Athens and Neopatras, whose inhabitants
petition their royal duke for redress of grievances and for the
appointment of suitable officials. But it is evident from the tenour of
these documents that the Catalan state was rapidly declining. In
addition to the Turkish peril and the menaces of the Venetians of Negroponte,
the once united soldiers of fortune were divided into factions,
which paralysed the central authority, and were aggravated by the
prolonged absence of the vicar-general in Sicily. One party wished to
place the duchies under the protection of Genoa, the natural enemy of
Venice, while two bitter rivals, Roger de Lluria and Pedro de Pou, or
Petrus de Puteo, the chief justice, an unjust judge and a grasping and
ambitious official, both claimed the title of vicar of the absent vicar-general.
Pou’s tyranny became so odious to Catalans and Greeks alike
that the former rose against him and slew him and his chief adherents.
The experiment of allowing the vicar-general as well as the duke to
remain an absentee had thus proved to be a failure; Lluria, as the
strongest man on the spot, was rewarded with the office of vicar-general
as the sole means of keeping the duchies intact. So vulnerable did the
Catalan state appear that the representatives of Walter of Brienne, the
Baron of Argos and the Count of Conversano, renewed the attempt of
their predecessor and, if we may believe the Aragonese <i>Chronicle of the
Morea</i>, actually occupied for a time the city of Athens.</p>

<p>The fast approaching Turkish danger ought to have united all the
Latin states of the Levant against the common foe, to whom they all eventually
succumbed. An attempt at union was made by Pope Gregory XI,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
at the instance of the Archbishop of Neopatras; and a congress
of the Christian rulers of the East was convened by him to meet at
Thebes in 1373. We can well imagine how the ancient city, the capital
of the Athenian duchy, was enlivened by the arrival of these more or less
eminent persons, or their envoys; how the Archbishops of Neopatras and
Naxos preached a new crusade against the infidel in the church of Our
Lady; how every one applauded their excellent advice; and how personal
jealousies marred the results of that, as of every subsequent congress on
the Eastern question. Scarcely had the delegates separated, when Nerio
Acciajuoli, Baron of Corinth, the boldest and astutest of them all, a
worthy scion of that great Florentine family of bankers established for
a generation in the principality of Achaia showed his appreciation of the
value of unity by seizing Megara as the first step on the way to Athens.
It is an interesting proof of the popularity of Catalan rule among those
Greeks, at any rate, who held office under the Company, that one of the
warmest defenders of Megara was a Greek notary, Demetrios Rendi, who
afterwards rose to a position of importance at Athens. Such was the
weakness of the once terrible Catalan state that the upstart Florentine’s
attack remained unavenged. The fall of Catalan rule was now only a
question of time.</p>

<p>The death of the royal Duke of Athens and Neopatras, Frederick III,
in 1377, yet further injured his Greek duchies. The duke had bequeathed
them to his young daughter Maria; but the succession was disputed by
King Pedro IV of Aragon, brother-in-law of Frederick III, who appealed
to the principle of the Salic law as laid down by that monarch’s predecessor,
Frederick II. The Catalans of Attica were naturally disinclined
to accept the government of a young girl at so critical a moment, when
the Turk was at their gates. All the three archbishops and the principal
barons and knights at once declared for the King of Aragon; but there
was a minority in favour of Maria, headed by the Venetian Marquess of
Boudonitza, who was eager to shake off the bond of vassalage to the
vicar-general. The burgesses, anxious for security, supported the Aragonese
party. At this moment, however, a third competitor appeared in
the duchies in the shape of the Navarrese Company, which sought to
repeat the exploits of the Catalans seventy years before. The researches
of the learned historian of the Catalans and Navarrese, Don Antonio
Rubió y Lluch, have thrown a flood of light upon this portion of the
Athenian annals, and have explained much that was hitherto obscure.
Employed originally by King Charles II of Navarre in his struggle with
Charles V of France, the Navarrese mercenaries had found their occupation
gone when those two rival sovereigns made peace in 1366. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
many vicissitudes they found congenial service, fourteen years later,
under the banner of Jacques de Baux, Prince of Achaia and the last
titular Emperor of Constantinople, who thought the moment had come
to recover his ancestors’ dominions.</p>

<p>Accordingly, early in 1380, they directed their steps towards Attica,
under the command of Mahiot de Coquerel, chamberlain of the King of
Navarre, and Pedro de Superan, surnamed Bordo, or the bastard<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.
These experienced leaders found valuable assistance in the chiefs of the
Sicilian party; in the knights of St John who sallied forth from the Morea
to pillage the distracted duchy; in the Count of Conversano, who seems
to have now made a second attempt to regain his ancestors’ heritage;
and in the mutual jealousies of Thebes and Athens, fomented by the
characteristic desire of the Athenians to be independent of Theban
supremacy. In Bœotia, one place after another fell before the adventurers
from Navarre; the noble castle of Livadia, which still preserves the
memory of its Catalan masters, was betrayed by a Greek from Durazzo;
and the capital was surrendered by two Spanish traitors. But the
fortress of Salona defied their assaults; and the Akropolis, thanks to the
bravery of its governor, Romeo de Bellarbe, and to the loyalty of the
ever useful notary, Demetrios Rendi, baffled the machinations of a little
band of malcontents. These severe checks broke the force of the soldiers
of Navarre; their appearance in Greece had alarmed all the petty
potentates of the Morea and the islands; and they withdrew to Bœotia,
whence, some two years later, they were finally dislodged. Thence they
proceeded to the Morea, where they carved out a principality, nominally
for Jacques de Baux, really for themselves.</p>

<p>The people of Athens and Salona, whose loyalty to the crown of
Aragon had saved the duchies, were well aware of the value of their
services, and were resolved to have their reward. Both communities
accordingly presented petitions to King Pedro; and these capitulations,
drawn up in the Catalan language, have fortunately been preserved in
the archives of Barcelona. Both the Athenian capitulations and those of
Salona are largely concerned with personal questions—requests that
this or that faithful person should receive privileges, lands, and honours,
especially his Majesty’s most loyal subject, the Greek, Demetrios Rendi.
From the date of the Frankish conquest no member of the conquered
race had ever risen to such eminence as this serviceable clerk, who now
obtained broad acres, goods, and serfs in both Attica and Bœotia. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
there were some clauses in the Athenian petition of a more general
character. The Athenians begged the central authorities at Thebes for
a continuance of their recently won independence, and for permission
to bequeath their property and serfs to the Catholic Church. Both these
prayers met with a blank refusal. King Pedro told the petitioners that
he intended to treat the duchies as an indivisible whole, and that home-rule
for Athens was quite out of the question. He also reminded them
that the Catalans were only a small garrison in Greece, and that, if holy
Church became possessed of their property, there would be no one left
to defend the country. He also observed that there was no hardship
in this, for the law of Athens was also that of his kingdoms of Majorca
and Valencia. The soundness of his Majesty’s statesmanship was obvious
in the peculiar conditions of the Catalan state; but this demand shows
the influence of the Church, an influence rarely found in the history of
Frankish Greece.</p>

<p>Of all the dukes who had held sway over Athens, Pedro IV was the
first to express himself in enthusiastic terms about the Akropolis. The
poetic monarch—himself a troubadour and a chronicler—described that
sacred rock in eloquent language as “the most precious jewel that exists
in the world, and such as all the kings of Christendom together would
imitate in vain.” He had doubtless heard from the lips of Bishop Boyl
of Megara, who was chaplain in the chapel of St Bartholomew in the
governor’s palace on the Akropolis, a description of the ancient buildings,
then almost uninjured, which the bishop knew so well. Yet he considered
twelve men-at-arms sufficient defence for the brightest jewel in
his crown.</p>

<p>Pedro now did his best to repair the ravages of the civil war; he
ordered a general amnesty for all the inhabitants of the duchies, and
showered rewards on faithful cities and individuals. Livadia, always a
privileged town in the Catalan period, not only received a confirmation
of its rights, but became the seat of the Order of St George in Greece,
an honour due to the fact that the head of the saint was then preserved
there. Most important of all for the future history of Greece, the king
granted exemption from taxes for two years to all Albanians who would
come and settle in the depleted duchies. This was the beginning of that
Albanian colonisation of Attica of which so many traces remain in the
population and the topography of the present day.</p>

<p>But the Albanian colonists came too late to save the Catalan domination.
From the heights of Akrocorinth and from the twin hills of Megara,
Nerio Acciajuoli, the Florentine upstart, had been attentively watching
the rapid dissolution of the Catalan power. He saw a land weakened by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
civil war and foreign invasion; he knew that the titular duke was an
absentee, engrossed with more important affairs; he found the ducal
viceroys summoned away to Spain or Sicily, while the old families of the
conquest were almost as extinct as the French whom they had displaced.
He was a man of action, without scruples, without fear, and he resolved
to strike. Hiring a galley from the Venetian arsenal at Candia, under
pretext of sweeping Turkish corsairs from the two seas, he assembled a
large force of cavalry, and sought an excuse for intervention. The pride
of a noble dame was the occasion of the fall of Athens. Nerio asked the
Dowager Countess of Salona to give her daughter’s hand to his brother-in-law,
Pietro Saraceno, scion of a Sienese family long settled in Eubœa.
The Countess, in whose veins flowed the Imperial blood of the Cantacuzenes,
scornfully rejected the offer of the Florentine tradesman, and
affianced her daughter to a Serbian princeling of Thessaly. Franks and
Greeks at Salona were alike indignant at this alliance with a Slav;
Nerio’s horsemen invaded the county and the rest of the duchy, while
his galley went straight for the Piræus. In the absence of a guiding hand—for
the vicar-general was away in Spain—the Catalans made no serious
resistance; only the Akropolis and a few other castles held out. In vain
the King of Aragon despatched Pedro de Pau to take the command;
that gallant officer, the last Catalan governor of the noblest fortress in
Europe, defended the “Castle of Athens” for more than a twelvemonth,
till, on May 2, 1388, it too surrendered to the Florentine. In vain, on
April 22, as a last resource, it had been offered to the Countess of Salona,
if she could save it<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. The new King of Aragon in vain promised the
<i>Sindici</i> of Athens to visit “so famous a portion of his realm,” and
announced that he was sending a fleet to “confound his enemies.” We
know not whether the fleet ever arrived; if it did, it was unsuccessful.
The sovereigns of Aragon might gratify their vanity by appointing a
titular vicar-general, or even a duke, of the duchies whose names they
still included in their titles; once, indeed, the news of an expedition
aroused alarm at Athens. But it proved to be merely the usual tall talk
of the Catalans; the flag of Aragon never waved again from the ramparts
of the Akropolis; the duchy passed to the Acciajuoli.</p>

<p>The Catalan Grand Company disappeared from the face of Attica
as rapidly as rain from its light soil. Like their Burgundian predecessors,
these soldiers of fortune conquered but struck no root in the
land. Some took ship for Sicily; some, like Ballester, the last Catalan
Archbishop of Athens, are heard of in Cataluña; while others, among
them the two branches of the Fadrique family, lingered on for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the one at Salona, the other at Ægina, where we find their connections,
the Catalan family of Caopena, ruling till 1451—a fact which explains
the boast of a much later Catalan writer, Peña y Farel, that his countrymen
maintained their “ancient splendour” in Greece till the middle of
the fifteenth century. Thither the Catalans conveyed the head of St
George, and thence it was removed to the Church of San Giorgio
Maggiore at Venice, when the Venetians succeeded the Caopena as
masters of Ægina. Even to-day a noble family in Zante bears the name
of Katalianos; and in the island of Santorin are three families of Spanish
origin—those of Da Corogna, De Cigalla, and Delenda, to which last the
recent Catholic Archbishop of Athens belonged. Besides the castles of
Salona, Livadia, and Lamia, and the row of towers between Livadia and
Thebes, the Catalans have left a memorial of their stay in Greece in the
curious fresco of the Virgin and Child, now in the Christian Archæological
Museum at Athens, which came from the church of the Prophet Elias
near the gate of the Agora. Unlike their predecessors, they minted no
coins; unlike them, they had no ducal court in their midst to stimulate
luxury and refinement. Yet even in the Athens of the Catalans there was
some culture. A diligent Athenian priest copied medical works; and we
hear of the libraries belonging to the Catholic bishops of Salona and
Megara.</p>

<p>The Greeks long remembered with terror the Catalan domination. A
Greek girl, in a mediæval ballad, prays that her seducer may “fall into
the hands of the Catalans”; even a generation ago the name of Catalan
was used as a term of reproach in Attica and in Eubœa, in Akarnania,
Messenia, Lakonia, and at Tripolitsa. Yet, as we have seen, the Greeks
did not raise a finger to assist a French restoration when they had the
chance, while there are several instances of Greeks rendering valuable
aid to the Catalans against the men of Navarre. Harsher they may have
been than the French, but they probably gained their bad name before
they settled down in Attica, and became more staid and more tolerant
as they became respectable. In our own time they have found admirers
and apologists among their own countrymen, who are justly proud of
the fact that the most famous city in the world was for two generations
governed by the sons of Cataluña. And in the history of Athens, where
nothing can lack interest, they, too, are entitled to a place.</p>

<h4 id="heading6">APPENDIX<br />
THE FRANKISH INSCRIPTION AT KARDITZA</h4>

<p>To students of Frankish Greece the church at Karditza in Bœotia
is one of the most interesting in the country, because it contains an
inscription referring to an important Frankish personage, Antoine le
Flamenc, and dating from the fatal year 1311, which witnessed the overthrow
of the Frankish Duchy of Athens in the swamps of the Bœotian
Kephissos. Buchon had twice<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> published this inscription; but, as I was
anxious to know in what condition it was and to have an exact facsimile
of it, I asked Mr D. Steel, the manager of the Lake Copais Company, to
have a fresh copy taken. Mr Steel kindly sent his Greek draughtsman to
copy the inscription, and at the same time visited the church and took the
photographs now published (Plate I, Figs. 1 and 2). Subsequently, in 1912,
I visited the church with him and saw the inscription, which is painted
on the plaster of the wall. Mr Steel informed me that, when he first saw
the church about 1880, “the extension of the west end,” clearly visible
in the photographs, “had not yet been made, while at that end there
existed a sort of verandah set on pieces of ancient columns.”</p>

<p>On comparing the present copy (Text-fig. 1) with Buchon’s versions,
it will be noticed that not only are there several differences of spelling,
but that the French scholar omitted one important addition to the year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
at the end of the inscription—the indiction, which is rightly given as the
9th. This is a further proof that the date of the inscription is 1311, which
corresponds with both the year 6819 and the 9th indiction. As the battle
of the Kephissos was fought on March 15th of that year, and as Antoine
le Flamenc is known to have survived the terrible carnage of that day,
we may surmise, as I have elsewhere suggested, that the work commemorated
in the inscription was “in pursuance of a vow made before
he went into action.”</p>

  <p class="caption">Fig. 1. <span class="smcap">Inscription on the Church at Karditza.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Antoine le Flamenc, whose ancestors had settled in the Holy Land, is
several times mentioned during the first decade of the fourteenth century.
The <i>Livre de la Conqueste</i><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> states that Guy II, Duke of Athens, appointed
him his “bailie and lieutenant” in Thessaly in 1303, and describes him
as <i>un des plus sages hommes de Romanie</i> and <i>le plus sage dou duchame</i>. The
same passage alludes also to Jean le Flamenc, his son, as receiving a post
in Thessaly. Doubtless their experience of the Wallachs, who then, as
now, wandered as winter approached from the Thessalian to the Bœotian
Karditza, would specially commend these two distinguished men for
such duties. Two years later we find Antoine as one of the witnesses of a
deed<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> regarding the property of the Duchess of Athens, just come of age
at Thebes, in her father’s land of Hainault. On April 2nd, 1309, both
Antoine and Jean were present at the engagement of the then widowed
Duchess with Charles of Taranto at Thebes<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. On the 23rd of a certain
month (? September) of 1308, a Venetian document<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> alludes to the
intention of <i>Fiammengo Antonio</i>, together with Guy II, Rocaforte, and
Bonifacio da Verona, to <i>tentar l’impresa di Negroponte</i>—in other words,
to make an attempt upon that Venetian colony. On August 11th, 1309,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
another Venetian letter, this time addressed to <i>Egregio militi Antonio
Fiammengo</i>, informs us that he had rented the property of Pietro Correr,
an absent canon of Thebes, and bids him not to consign the rents to any
but the rightful person. A second letter of the same day, addressed to
the bailie and councillors of Negroponte, mentions him again in connection
with this affair<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Finally, the list of Greek dignitaries, with whom
the Republic was in correspondence, originally drawn up before the
battle of the Kephissos and then corrected in 1313, mentions <i>Ser
Antonius Flamengo miles</i><a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. As his name is not followed by the word
<i>decessit</i> or <i>mortuus</i>, added to those who had fallen in the battle, he was
one of the very few survivors.</p>

<p>To these certain facts Hopf<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> added the assumption, based on no
evidence, that he was the “Frank settled in the East,” whom Isabella,
Marchioness of Boudonitza, married, and who, in 1286, disputed the
succession to that castle with her cousin.</p>

<p>As Buchon’s books are rare, I append his transcript of the inscription:</p>

<h3 id="heading7">5. FLORENTINE ATHENS</h3>

<p>The history of mediæval Athens is full of surprises. A Burgundian
nobleman founding a dynasty in the ancient home of heroes and
philosophers; a roving band of mercenaries from the westernmost
peninsula of Europe destroying in a single day the brilliant French
civilisation of a century; a Florentine upstart, armed with the modern
weapons of finance, receiving the keys of the Akropolis from a gallant
and chivalrous soldier of Spain—such are the tableaux which inaugurate
the three epochs of her Frankish annals. In an earlier paper in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> (January 1907) we dealt with the French and the
Catalan periods; we now propose to trace the third and last phase of
Latin rule over the most famous of Greek cities.</p>

<p>When, in the spring of 1388, Nerio Acciajuoli found himself master
of “the Castle of Setines,” as the Franks called the Akropolis, his first
care was to conciliate the Greeks, who formed by far the largest part of
his subjects, and who may have aided him to conquer the Athenian
duchy. For the first time since the day, nearly two centuries before,
when Akominatos had fled from his beloved cathedral to exile at Keos,
a Greek Metropolitan of Athens was allowed to reside in his see, not,
indeed, on the sacred rock itself, but beneath the shadow of the Areopagos.
We may be sure that this remarkable concession was prompted,
not by sentiment, but by policy, though the policy was perhaps mistaken.
The Greek hierarchy has in all ages been distinguished for its
political character; and the presence of a high Greek ecclesiastic at
Athens at once provided his fellow-countrymen with a national leader
against the rulers, whom they distrusted as foreigners and he hated as
schismatics. He was ready to call in the aid of the Turks against his
fellow-Christians, just as in modern Macedonia a Greek bishop abhorred
the followers of the Bulgarian Exarch far more than those of the Prophet.
Thus early in Florentine Athens were sown the seeds of the Turkish
domination; thus, in the words of the Holy Synod, “the Athenian
Church seemed to have recovered its ancient happiness such as it had
enjoyed before the barbarian conquest<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.”</p>

<p>Nor was it the Church alone which profited by the change of dynasty.
Greek for the first time became the official language of the Government;
Nerio and his accomplished daughter, the Countess of Cephalonia, used
it in their public documents; the Countess, the most masterful woman
of the Latin Orient, proudly signed herself, in the cinnabar ink of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Byzantium, “Empress of the Romans”; even Florentines settled at
Athens assumed the Greek translation of their surnames. Thus, a branch
of the famous Medici family was transplanted to Athens, became
completely Hellenised under the name of Iatros, and has left behind it
a progeny which scarcely conceals, beneath that of Iatropoulos, its
connection with the mediæval rulers of Florence. There is even evidence
that the “elders” of the Greek community were allowed a share in the
municipal government of Florentine, no less than in that of Turkish,
Athens.</p>

<p>Hitherto the career of Nerio Acciajuoli had been one of unbroken
success. His star had guided him from Florence to Akrocorinth, and
from Akrocorinth to the Akropolis; his two daughters, one famed as the
most beautiful, the other as the most talented woman of her time, were
married to the chief Greek and to the leading Latin potentate of Greece—to
Theodore Palaiologos, Despot of Mistra, and to Carlo Tocco, the
Neapolitan noble who ruled over the County Palatine of Cephalonia.
These alliances seemed to guard him against every foe. He was now
destined, however, to experience one of those sudden turns of fortune
which were peculiarly characteristic of Frankish Greece. He was
desirous of rounding off his dominions by the acquisition of the castles
of Nauplia and Argos, which had been appendages of the French Duchy
of Athens, but which, during the Catalan period, had remained loyal to
the family of Brienne and to its heirs, the house of Enghien. In 1388,
Marie d’Enghien, the Lady of Argos, left a young and helpless widow,
had transferred her Argive estates to Venice, which thus began its long
domination over the ancient kingdom of Agamemnon. But, before the
Venetian commissioner had had time to take possession, Nerio had
instigated his son-in-law, the Despot of Mistra, to seize Argos by a <i>coup
de main</i>. For this act of treachery he paid dearly. It was not merely that
the indignant Republic broke off all commercial relations between her
colonies and Athens, but she also availed herself of the Navarrese
Company, which was now established in the Morea, as the fitting
instrument of her revenge. The Navarrese commander accordingly
invited Nerio to a personal conference on the question of Argos; and the
shrewd Florentine, with a childlike simplicity remarkable in one who
had lived so many years in the Levant, accepted the invitation, and
deliberately placed himself in the power of his enemies. The opportunity
was too good to be lost; the law of nations was mere waste-paper to the
men of Navarre; Nerio was arrested and imprisoned in a Peloponnesian
prison. At once the whole Acciajuoli clan set to work to obtain the
release of their distinguished relative; the Archbishop of Florence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
implored the intervention of the Pope; the Florentine Government
offered the most liberal terms to Venice; a message was despatched to
Amedeo of Savoy; most efficacious of all, the aid of Genoa was invoked
on behalf of one whose daughter was a Genoese citizen. Nerio was
released; but his ransom was disastrous to Athens. In order to raise
the requisite amount, he stripped the silver plates off the doors
of the Parthenon and seized the gold, silver and precious stones
which the piety of many generations had given to that venerable
cathedral.</p>

<p>Nerio was once more free, but he was not long allowed to remain
undisturbed in his palace on the Akropolis. The Sicilian royal family
now revived its claims to the Athenian duchy, and even nominated a
phantom vicar-general<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>; and, what was far more serious, the Turks,
under the redoubtable Evrenos Beg, descended upon Attica. The overthrow
of the Serbian Empire on the fatal field of Kossovo had now
removed the last barrier between Greece and her future masters; and
Bayezid, “the Thunderbolt,” fell upon that unprotected land. The
blow struck Nerio’s neighbour, the Dowager Countess of Salona, the
proud dame who had so scornfully rejected his suit nine years before.
Ecclesiastical treachery and corruption sealed the fate of that ancient
fief of the Stromoncourts, the Deslaurs, and the Fadriques, amid tragic
surroundings, which a modern Greek drama has endeavoured to depict<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
The Dowager Countess had allowed her paramour, a priest, to govern in
her name; and this petty tyrant had abused his power to wring money
from the shepherds of Parnassos and to debauch the damsels of Delphi
by his demoniacal incantations in the classic home of the supernatural.
At last he cast his eyes on the fair daughter and full money-bags of the
Greek bishop; deprived of his child and fearing for his gold, the bishop
roused his flock against the monster and begged the Sultan to occupy
a land so well adapted for his Majesty’s favourite pastimes of hunting
and riding as is the plain at the foot of Parnassos. The Turks accepted
the invitation; the priest shut himself up in the noble castle, slew the
bishop’s daughter, and prepared to fight. But there was treachery among
the garrison; a man of Salona murdered the tyrant and offered his head
to the Sultan; and the Dowager Countess and her daughter in vain
endeavoured to appease the conqueror with gifts. Bayezid sent the
young Countess to his harem; her mother he handed over to the insults
of his soldiery, her land he assigned to one of his lieutenants. Her
memory still clings to the “pomegranate” cliff (ροιά) at Salona, whence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
according to the local legend, repeated to the author on the spot, “the
princess” was thrown.</p>

<p>Nerio feared for his own dominions, whence the Greek Metropolitan
had fled—so it was alleged—to the Turkish camp, and had promised the
infidels the treasures of the Athenian Church in return for their aid. For
the moment, however, the offer of tribute saved the Athenian duchy;
but its ruler hastened to implore the aid of the Pope and of King
Ladislaus of Naples against the enemies of Christendom, and at the
same time sought formal recognition of his usurpation from that monarch,
at whose predecessors’ court the fortunes of his family had originated,
and who still pretended to be the suzerain of Achaia, and therefore of its
theoretical dependency, Athens. Ladislaus, nothing loth, in 1394
rewarded the self-seeking Florentine for having recovered the Duchy
of Athens “from certain of His Majesty’s rivals,” with the title of duke,
with remainder—as Nerio had no legitimate sons—to his brother Donato
and the latter’s heirs. Cardinal Angelo Acciajuoli, another brother, was
to invest the new duke with a golden ring; and it was expressly provided
that Athens should cease to be a vassal state of Achaia, but should
thenceforth own no overlord save the King of Naples. The news that one
of their clan had obtained the glorious title of Duke of Athens filled the
Acciajuoli with pride—such was the fascination which the name of that
city exercised in Italy. Boccaccio, half a century before, had familiarised
his countrymen with a title which Walter of Brienne, the tyrant of
Florence, had borne as of right, and which, as applied to Nerio Acciajuoli,
was no empty flourish of the herald’s college.</p>

<p>The first Florentine Duke of Athens did not, however, long survive
the realisation of his ambition. On September 25 of the same year he
died, laden with honours, the type of a successful statesman. But, as he
lay on his sick-bed at Corinth, the dying man seems to have perceived
that he had founded his fortunes on the sand. Pope and King might
give him honours and promises; they could not render effective aid
against the Turks. It was under the shadow of this coming danger that
Nerio drew up his remarkable will.</p>

<p>His first care was for the Parthenon, Our Lady of Athens, in which
he directed that his body should be laid to rest. He ordered its doors to
be replated with silver, its stolen treasures to be bought up and restored
to it; he provided that, besides the twelve canons of the cathedral, there
should be twenty priests to say masses for the repose of his soul; and he
bequeathed to the Athenian minster, for their support and for the
maintenance of its noble fabric, the city of Athens, with its dependencies,
and all the brood-mares of his valuable stud. Seldom has a church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
received such a remarkable endowment; the Cathedral of Monaco, built
out of the earnings of a gaming-table, is perhaps the closest parallel to
the Parthenon maintained by the profits of a stud-farm. Nerio made his
favourite daughter, the Countess of Cephalonia, his principal heiress;
to her he bequeathed his castles of Megara, Sikyon, and Corinth, while
to his natural son, Antonio, he left the government of Thebes, Livadia,
and all beyond it. To the bastard’s mother, Maria Rendi, daughter of
the ever-serviceable Greek notary who had been so prominent in the last
years of the Catalan domination, and had retained his position under
the new dynasty, her lover granted the full franchise, with the right to
retain all her property, including, perhaps, the spot between Athens and
the Piræus which still preserves the name of her family. Finally, he
recommended his land to the care of the Venetian Republic, which he
begged to protect his heiress and to carry out his dispositions for the
benefit of Our Lady of Athens.</p>

<p>Donato Acciajuoli made no claim to succeed his brother in the Duchy
of Athens. He was Gonfaloniere of Florence and Senator of Rome; and
he preferred those safe and dignified positions in Italy to the glamour of
a ducal coronet in Greece, in spite of the natural desire of the family
that one of their name should continue to take his title from Athens<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.
But it was obvious that a conflict would arise between the sons-in-law
of the late duke, for Nerio had practically disinherited his elder daughter
in favour of her younger but abler sister. Carlo Tocco of Cephalonia at
once demanded the places bequeathed to his wife, occupied Megara
and Corinth, and imprisoned the terrified executors in his island till they
had signed a document stating that he had carried out the terms of his
father-in-law’s will. Theodore Palaiologos, who contended that Corinth
had always been intended to be his after Nerio’s death, besieged it with
a large force, till Tocco, calling in a still larger Turkish army, drove his
brother-in-law from the Isthmus<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Greeks of Athens had followed the same fatal policy
of invoking the common enemy as arbiter of their affairs. It was not
to be expected that the Greek race, which had of late recovered its
national consciousness, and which had ever remained deeply attached
to its religion, would quietly acquiesce in the extraordinary arrangement
by which the city of Athens was made the property of the Catholic
cathedral. The professional jealousy and the <i>odium theologicum</i> of the
two great ecclesiastics, Makarios, the Greek Metropolitan, and Ludovico
da Prato, the Latin archbishop, envenomed the feelings of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
The Greek divine summoned Timourtash, the Turkish commander, to
rid Athens of the <i>filioque</i> clause; and his strange ally occupied the lower
town. The castle, however, was bravely defended by Matteo de Montona,
one of the late duke’s executors, who despatched a messenger in hot
haste to the Venetian colony of Negroponte, offering to hand over
Athens to the Republic if the governor would promise in her name to
respect the ancient franchises and customs of the Athenians. The bailie
of Negroponte agreed, subject to the approval of the home Government,
and sent a force which dispersed the Turks, and, at the close of 1394,
for the first time in history, hoisted the lion-banner of the Evangelist
on the ancient castle of Athens.</p>

<p>The Republic decided, after mature consideration, to accept the offer
of the Athenian commander. No sentimental argument, no classical
memories, weighed with the sternly practical statesmen of the lagoons.
The romantic King of Aragon had waxed enthusiastic over the glories
of the Akropolis; and sixty years later the greatest of Turkish Sultans
contemplated his conquest with admiration. But the sole reason which
decided the Venetian Government to annex Athens was its proximity
to the Venetian colonies, and the consequent danger which might ensue
to them if it fell into Turkish or other hands. Thus Venice took over the
Akropolis in 1395, not because it was a priceless monument, but because
it was a strong fortress; she saved the Athenians, not, as Cæsar had done,
for the sake of their ancestors, but for that of her own colonies, “the
pupil of her eye.” From the financial point of view, indeed, Athens could
not have been a valuable asset. The Venetians confessed that they did
not know what its revenues and expenses were; and, pending a detailed
report from their governor, they ordered that only eight priests should
serve “in the Church of St Mary of Athens”—an act of economy due
to the fact that some of Nerio’s famous brood-mares had been stolen and
the endowment of the cathedral consequently diminished. On such
accidents did the maintenance of the Parthenon depend in the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>We are fortunately in a better position than was the Venetian
Government to judge of the contemporary state of Athens. At the very
time when its fate was under discussion an Italian notary spent two days
in that city; and his diary is the first account which any traveller has
left us, from personal observation, of its condition during the Frankish
period<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. “The city,” he says, “which nestles at the foot of the castle hill,
contains about a thousand hearths” but not a single inn, so that, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the archæologist in some country towns of modern Greece, he had to
seek the hospitality of the clergy. He describes “the great hall” of the
castle (the Propylaia), with its thirteen columns, and tells how the
churchwardens personally conducted him over “the Church of St Mary,”
which had sixty columns without and eighty within. On one of the
latter he was shown the cross made by Dionysios the Areopagite at the
moment of the earthquake which attended our Lord’s passion; four
others, which surrounded the high altar, were of jasper and supported
a dome, while the doors came—so he was told—from Troy. The pious
Capuan was then taken to see the relics of the Athenian cathedral—the
figure of the Virgin painted by St Luke, the head of St Makarios, a bone
of St Denys of France, an arm of St Justin, and a copy of the Gospels
written by the hand of St Elena—relics which the wife of King Pedro IV
of Aragon had in vain begged the last Catalan archbishop to send her
fifteen years before<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>He saw, too, in a cleft of the wall, the light which never fails, and
outside, beyond the castle ramparts, the two pillars of the choragic
monument of Thrasyllos, between which there used to be “a certain
idol” in an iron-bound niche, gifted with the strange power of drowning
hostile ships as soon as they appeared on the horizon—an allusion to the
story of the Gorgon’s head, mentioned by Pausanias, which we find in
later mediæval accounts of Athens. In the city below he noticed numbers
of fallen columns and fragments of marble; he alludes to the Stadion;
and he visited the “house of Hadrian,” as the temple of Olympian Zeus
was popularly called. He completed his round by a pilgrimage to the so-called
“Study of Aristotle, whence scholars drank to obtain wisdom”—the
aqueduct, whose marble beams, commemorating the completion of
Hadrian’s work by Antoninus Pius, were then to be seen at the foot of
Lykabettos, and, after serving in Turkish times as the lintel of the
Boubounistra gate, now lie, half buried by vegetation, in the palace
garden. But the fear of the prowling Turks and the feud between Nerio’s
two sons-in-law rendered travelling in Attica difficult; the notary
traversed the Sacred Way in fear of his life, and was not sorry to find
himself in the castle of Corinth, though the houses in that city were few
and mean, and the total population did not exceed fifty families.</p>

<p>The Venetian Government next arranged for the future administration
of its new colony. The governor of Athens was styled <i>podestà</i> and
captain, and was appointed for the usual term of two years at an annual
salary of £70, out of which he had to keep a notary, an assistant, four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
servants, two grooms, and four horses. Four months elapsed before a
noble was found ambitious of residing in Athens on these terms, and of
facing the difficult situation there. Attica was so poor that he had to ask
his Government for a loan; the Turkish corsairs infested the coast; the
Greek Metropolitan, though now under lock and key at Venice, still
found means of communicating with his former allies. Turkish writers
even boast—and a recently published document confirms their statement—that
their army captured “the city of the sages” in 1397; and an
Athenian dirge represented Athens mourning the enslavement of the
husbandmen of her suburb of Sepolia, who will no longer be able to till
the fields of Patesia.</p>

<p>The Turkish invaders came and went; but another and more obstinate
enemy ever watched the little Venetian garrison on the Akropolis. The
bastard Antonio Acciajuoli fretted within the walls of his Theban
domain, and was resolved to conquer Athens, as his father had done
before him. In vain did Venice, alarmed by the reports of her successive
governors, raise the numbers of the garrison to fifty-six men; in vain did
she order money to be spent on the defences of the castle; in vain did she
attempt to pacify the discontented Athenians, who naturally preferred
the rule of an Acciajuoli who was half a Greek to that of a Venetian noble.
By the middle of 1402 Antonio was master of the lower city; it seemed
that, unless relief came at once, he would plant his banner on the
Akropolis. The Senate, at this news, ordered the bailie of Negroponte to
offer a reward for the body of the bold bastard, alive or dead, to lay
Thebes in ashes, and to save the castle of Athens. That obedient official
set out at the head of six thousand men to execute the second of these
injunctions, only to fall into an ambush which his cunning enemy had
laid in the pass of Anephorites. Venice, now alarmed for the safety of
her most valuable colony far more than for that of Athens, hastily sent
commissioners to make peace. But Antonio calmly continued the siege
of the Akropolis, till at last, seventeen months after his first appearance
before the city, when the garrison had eaten the last horse, and had been
reduced to devour the plants which grew on the castle rock, its gallant
defenders, Vitturi and Montona, surrendered with the honours of war.
The half-caste adventurer had beaten the great Republic.</p>

<p>Venice attempted to recover by diplomacy what she had lost by
arms. She possessed in Pietro Zeno, the baron of Andros, a diplomatist
of unrivalled experience in the tortuous politics of the Levant. Both he
and Antonio were well aware that the fate of Athens depended upon the
Sultan; and to his Court they both repaired, armed with those pecuniary
arguments which have usually proved convincing to Turkish ministers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
The diplomatic duel was lengthy; but at last the Venetian gained one of
those paper victories so dear to ambassadors and so worthless to practical
men. The Sultan promised to see that Athens was restored to the
Republic, but he took no steps to perform his promise; while Antonio,
backed by the Acciajuoli influence in Italy, by the Pope, and the King
of Naples, held his ground. Venice wisely resigned herself to the loss of a
colony which it would have been expensive to recover. To save appearances,
Antonio was induced to become her vassal for “the land, castle,
and place of Athens, in modern times called Sythines<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>,” sending every
year, in token of his homage, a silk <i>pallium</i> from the Theban manufactories
to the church of St Mark—a condition which he was most
remiss in fulfilling.</p>

<p>The reign of Antonio Acciajuoli—the longest in the history of Athens
save that of the recent King of the Hellenes—was a period of prosperity
and comparative tranquillity for that city. While all around him
principalities and powers were shaken to their foundations; while that
ancient warden of the northern March of Athens, the Marquisate of
Boudonitza, was swept away for ever; while Turkish armies invaded the
Morea, and annexed the Albanian capital to the Sultan’s empire; while
the principality of Achaia disappeared from the map in the throes of a
tardy Greek revival, the statesmanlike ruler of Athens skilfully guided
the policy of his duchy. At times even his experienced diplomacy failed
to avert the horrors of a Turkish raid; on one occasion he was forced to
join, as a Turkish vassal, in an invasion of the Morea. But, as a rule, the
dreaded Mussulmans spared this half-Oriental, who was a past-master
in the art of managing the Sultan’s ministers. From the former masters
of Athens, the Catalans and the Venetians, he had nothing to fear. Once,
indeed, he received news that Alfonso V of Aragon, who never forgot to
sign himself “Duke of Athens and Neopatras,” intended to put one of
his Catalan subjects into possession of those duchies. But Venice reassured
him with a shrewd remark that the Catalans usually made much
ado about nothing. On her part the Republic was friendly to the man
who had supplanted her. She gave Antonio permission, in case of
danger, to send the valuable Acciajuoli stud—for, like his father, he was
a good judge of horse-flesh—to the island of Eubœa; and she ordered
her bailie to “observe the ancient commercial treaties between the
duchy and the island, which he would find in the chancery of Negroponte.”
But when he sought to lay the foundations of a navy, and
strove to prevent the fruitful island of Ægina, then the property of the
Catalan family of Caopena, from falling into the hands of Venice, he met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
with a severe rebuff. To the Florentine Duke of Athens Ægina, as a
Venetian colony, might well seem, as it had seemed to Aristotle, the
“eyesore of the Piræus.”</p>

<p>With his family’s old home, Florence, Antonio maintained the
closest relations. In 1422 a Florentine ambassador arrived in Athens
with instructions to confer the freedom of the great Tuscan Commonwealth
upon the Duke; to inform him that Florence, having now, by
the destruction of Pisa and the purchase of Leghorn, become a maritime
power, intended to embark in the Levant trade; and to ask him, therefore,
for the benefit of the most-favoured-nation clause. Antonio gladly
made all Florentine ships free of his harbours, and reduced the usual
customs dues in favour of all Florentine merchants throughout his
dominions. Visitors from Tuscany, when they landed at Riva d’Ostia,
on the Gulf of Corinth, must, indeed, have felt themselves in the land
of a friendly prince, though his Court on the Akropolis presented a
curious mixture of the Greek and the Florentine elements. Half a Greek
himself, Antonio chose both his wives from that race—the first the
beautiful daughter of a Greek priest, to whom he had lost his heart in
the mazes of a wedding-dance at Thebes; the second an heiress of the
great Messenian family of Melissenos, whose bees and bells are not the
least picturesque escutcheon in the heraldry of mediæval Greece. As he
had no children, numbers of the Acciajuoli clan came to Athens with an
eye to the ducal coronet, which had conferred such lustre upon the steel-workers
and bankers of Brescia and Florence. One cousin settled down
at the castle of Sykaminon, near Oropos, which had belonged to the
Knights of the Hospital, and served his kinsman as an ambassador;
another became bishop of Cephalonia, the island of that great lady, the
Countess Francesca, whom Froissart describes as a mediæval Penelope,
whose maids of honour made silken coverings so fine that there was none
like them, and whose splendid hospitality delighted the French nobles
on their way home from a Turkish prison after the battle of Nikopolis.
Two other Acciajuoli were archbishops of Thebes; and towards the close
of Antonio’s long reign a second generation of the family had grown up
in Greece. With such names as Acciajuoli, Medici, Pitti, and Machiavelli
at the Athenian Court, Attica had, indeed, become a Florentine colony.</p>

<p>Antonio and his Florentine relatives must have led a merry life in
their delectable duchy. In the family correspondence we find allusions
to hawking and partridge shooting; and the ducal stable provided good
mounts for the young Italians who scoured the plains of Attica and
Bœotia in quest of game. The cultured Florentines were delighted with
Athens and the Akropolis. “You have never seen,” wrote Nicolò<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Machiavelli to one of his cousins, “a fairer land nor yet a fairer fortress
than this.” It was there, in the venerable Propylaia, that Antonio had
fixed his ducal residence. No great alterations were required to convert
the classic work of Mnesikles into a Florentine palace. All that the
Acciajuoli seem to have done was to cut the two vestibules in two so as
to make four rooms, to fill up the spaces between the pillars with walls—removed
so recently as 1835—and to add a second storey, the joist-sockets
of which are still visible, to both that building and the Pinakotheke,
which either then, or in the Turkish times, was crowned with
battlements.</p>

<p>To the Florentine dukes is also usually ascribed the construction of
the square “Frankish tower,” which stood opposite the Temple of Nike
Apteros till it was pulled down in 1874 by one of those acts of pedantic
barbarism which considers one period of history alone worthy of study,
instead of regarding every historical monument as a precious landmark
in the evolution of a nation. We can well believe that the Florentine
watchman from the projecting turret daily swept sea and land in all
directions, save where the massive cathedral of Our Lady shut out part
of Hymettos from his view; and at night the beacon-fire kindled on the
summit warned Akrocorinth of the approach of Turkish horsemen or
rakish-looking galleys. Nor did the Italians limit their activity as
builders to the castle-crag alone. Chalkokondyles expressly says that
Antonio’s long and peaceful administration enabled him to beautify the
city. There is evidence that the dukes possessed a beautiful villa at the
spring of Kallirrhoe, and that close by they were wont to pray in the
church of St Mary’s-on-the-rock, once a temple of Triptolemos. More
than two centuries later a French ambassador heard mass in this church;
and one of his companions found the lion rampant and the three lilies
of the Florentine bankers, which visitors to the famous Certosa know so
well, still guarding—<i>auspicium melioris ævi</i>—the entrance of the
Turkish bazaar<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<p>Of literary culture there are some few traces in Florentine Athens.
It was in Antonio’s reign that Athens gave birth to her last historian,
Laonikos Chalkokondyles, the Herodotos of mediæval Greece, who told
the story of the new Persian invasion, and to his brother Demetrios, who
did so much to diffuse Greek learning in Italy. Another of Antonio’s
subjects is known to scholars as a copyist of manuscripts at Siena; and
it is obvious that the two Italian Courts of Athens and Joannina were
regarded as places where professional men might find openings. A young
Italian writes from Arezzo to ask if either Antonio Acciajuoli or Carlo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Tocco could give him a chair of jurisprudence, logic, medicine, or
natural or moral philosophy<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. Unfortunately, we are not told whether
the modest request of this universal genius was granted or not.</p>

<p>Thus, for a long period, the Athenian duchy enjoyed peace and
prosperity, broken only by a terrible visitation of the plague and further
diminished by emigration—that scourge of modern Greece. But the
modern Greeks have not the twin institutions, serfdom and slavery, on
which mediæval society rested. Even the enlightened Countess of
Cephalonia presented a young female slave to one of her cousins, with
full power to sell or otherwise dispose of her as he pleased. Antonio did
all in his power to retain the useful Albanians, who had entered his
dominions in large numbers after the capture of the Despotat of Epeiros
by Carlo Tocco in 1418, and thus rendered a service to Attica, the results
of which are felt to this present hour. It is to the wise policy of her last
Aragonese and her second Florentine duke that that Albanian colonisation
is due which has given “the thin soil” of Attica numbers of sturdy
cultivators, who still speak Albanian as well as Greek, and still preserve
in such village names as Spata, Liosia, and Liopesi, the memory of the
proud Albanian chieftains of Epeiros. Greek influence, too, grew steadily
under a dynasty which was now half Hellenised. The notary and
chancellor of the city continued to be a Greek; and a Greek <i>archon</i> was,
for the first time since the Frankish conquest, to play a leading part in
Athenian politics<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When one morning in 1435, after a reign of thirty-two years,
Antonio’s attendants found him dead in his bed, a Greek as well as an
Italian party disputed the succession. The Italian candidate, young
Nerio, eldest son of Franco Acciajuoli, baron of Sykaminon, whom the
late Duke had adopted as his heir, occupied the city. But the Duchess
Maria Melissene and her kinsman, Chalkokondyles, father of the historian
and the leading man of Athens, held the castle. Well aware,
however, that the Sultan was the real master of the situation, the Greek
<i>archon</i> set out for the Turkish Court to obtain Murad II’s consent to
this act of usurpation. The Sultan scornfully rejected the bribes of the
Athenian diplomatist, threw him into prison, and sent his redoubtable
captain, Tourakhan, to occupy Thebes. Even then the Greek Duchess
did not abandon all hope of securing Athens for the national cause.
Through the historian Phrantzes she made an arrangement with
Constantine Palaiologos, the future Emperor, then one of the Despots of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
the Morea, and the foremost champion of Hellenism, that he should
become Duke of Athens, and that she should receive compensation near
her old home in the Peloponnese. This scheme would have united nearly
all Greece under the Imperial family; but it was doomed to failure. There
was a section of Greeks at Athens hostile to Chalkokondyles—for party
spirit has always characterised Greek public life—and this section joined
the Florentine party, decoyed the Duchess out of the Akropolis, and
proclaimed Nerio II. The marriage of the new Duke with the Dowager
Duchess<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and the banishment of the family of Chalkokondyles secured
the internal peace of the distracted city; and the Sultan was well content
to allow a Florentine princeling to retain the phantom of power so long
as he paid his tribute with regularity.</p>

<p>The weak and effeminate Nerio II was exactly suited for the part of
a Turkish puppet. But, like many feeble rulers, the “lord of Athens and
Thebes” seems to have made himself unpopular by his arrogance; and
a few years after his accession he was deprived of his throne by an
intrigue of his brother, Antonio II. He then retired to Florence, the
home of his family, where he had property, to play the part of a prince
in exile, if exile it could be called. There he must have been living at the
time of the famous Council, an echo of whose decisions we hear in distant
Athens, where a Greek priest, of rather more learning than most of his
cloth, wrote to the Œcumenical Patriarch on the proper form of public
prayer for the Pope. A bailie—so we learn from one of his letters<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>—was
then administering the duchy, for Antonio had died in 1441; his
infant son, Franco, was absent at the Turkish Court; and his subjects
had recalled their former lord to the Akropolis. There he was seen, three
years later, by the first antiquary who ever set foot in Frankish Athens,
Cyriacus of Ancona, the Pausanias of mediæval Greece.</p>

<p>That extraordinary man, like Schliemann, a merchant by profession
but an archæologist by inclination, had already once visited Athens. In
1436 he had stayed there for a fortnight as the guest of a certain
Antonelli Balduini; but on that occasion he was too much occupied
copying inscriptions to seek an audience of the Duke. He, too, like the
Capuan notary, went to see “Aristotle’s Study”; he describes the
“house” or “palace of Hadrian”; he alludes to the statue of the Gorgon
on the south of the Akropolis. But of contemporary Athens, apart from
the monuments, he tells us little beyond the facts that it possessed four
gates and that it had “new walls”—a statement corroborated by that
of another traveller thirty years later, which might indicate the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
wall of Valerian as the work of the Acciajuoli<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. Of the inhabitants
he says nothing; as living Greeks, they had for him no interest; was he not
an archæologist?</p>

<p>In February 1444 the worthy Cyriacus revisited Athens; and on this
occasion, accompanied by the Duke’s cousin and namesake, he went to
pay his respects to “Nerio Acciajuoli of Florence, then prince of Athens,”
whom he “found on the Akropolis, the lofty castle of the city<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.” Again,
however, the archæological overpowered the human interest; and he
hastened away from the ducal presence to inspect the Propylaia and the
Parthenon. His original drawing of the west front of the latter building
has been preserved in a manuscript, which formerly belonged to the
Duke of Hamilton, but is now in the Berlin Museum, and is the earliest
known pictorial reproduction of that splendid temple<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. Other Athenian
sketches may be seen in the Barberini manuscript of 1465, now at the
Vatican, which contains the diagrams of San Gallo; and it seems that
the eminent architect, who took the explanatory text almost <i>verbatim</i>
from the note-books of Cyriacus, also copied the latter’s drawings.</p>

<p>The travels of the antiquary of Ancona in Greece demonstrate an
interesting fact, which has too often been ignored, that the Latin rulers
of the Levant were sometimes men of culture and taste. Crusino
Sommaripa, the baron of Paros, took a pride in showing his visitor some
marble statues which he had had excavated, and allowed him to send a
marble head and leg to his friend Giustiniani-Banca, of Chios, a connoisseur
of art who composed Italian verses in his “Homeric” villa.
So deeply was Cyriacus moved by Crusino’s culture and kindness that
he too burst out into an Italian poem, of which happily only one line
has been published. Dorino Gattilusio, the Genoese lord of Lesbos, aided
him in his investigation of that island; the Venetian governor of Tenos
escorted him in his state-galley to inspect the antiquities of Delos; and
Carlo Tocco II, whom he quaintly describes as “King of the Epeirotes,”
gave him every facility for visiting the ruins of Dodona, and was
graciously pleased to cast his royal eye over the manuscript account of
the antiquary’s journey<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. Another of the Tocchi is known to have
employed a Greek priest to copy for him the works of Origen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
Chrysostom; and in the remote Peloponnesian town of Kalavryta
Cyriacus met a kindred soul, who possessed a large library from which he
lent the wandering archæologist a copy of Herodotos. Thus, on the eve
of the Turkish conquest, Greece was by no means so devoid of culture as
has sometimes been too hastily assumed. It is clear, on the contrary,
that her Frankish princes were by no means indifferent to their surroundings,
and that the more enlightened of her own sons were conscious
of her great past.</p>

<p>The very year of the antiquary’s second visit to Athens witnessed
the last attempt of a patriotic and ambitious Greek to recover all
Greece for his race. The future Emperor Constantine was now Despot
of Mistra, the mediæval Sparta; and he thought that the moment had
at last come for renewing the plan for the annexation of the Athenian
duchy which had failed nine years before. The Turks, hard pressed by
the Hungarians and Poles, defeated by “the white knight of Wallachia”
at Nish, defied by Skanderbeg in the mountains of Albania, and
threatened by the appearance of a Venetian fleet in the Ægean, could no
longer protect their creature at Athens. Ere long the last Constantine
entered the gates of Thebes and forced Nerio II to pay him tribute. The
Court of Naples heard that he had actually occupied Athens; and
Alfonso V of Aragon, who had never forgotten that he was still titular
Duke of Athens and Neopatras, wrote at once to Constantine demanding
the restitution of the two duchies to himself, and sent the Marquess of
Gerace to receive them from the conqueror’s hands. Scarcely, however,
had the letter been despatched when the fatal news of the great Turkish
victory at Varna reached the writer. We hear nothing more of Gerace’s
mission, for all recognised that the fate of Athens now depended upon
the will of the victorious Sultan. To Murad II the shadowy claims of the
house of Aragon and the efforts of the house of Palaiologos were alike
indifferent.</p>

<p>Nerio’s attitude at this crisis was pitiful in the extreme. The Turks
punished him for having given way to Constantine. Constantine again
threatened him for his obsequiousness in promising to renew his tribute
to the Turks. But the Sultan, true to the traditional Turkish policy of
supporting the weaker of two rival Christian nationalities, forced the
Greek Despot to evacuate the Florentine duchy. Nerio had the petty
satisfaction of accompanying his lord and master to the Isthmus and of
witnessing the capture of the famous Six-mile Rampart, in which the
Greeks had vainly trusted, by the Serbian janissaries. Five years later,
in 1451, a Venetian despatch gives us a last and characteristic glimpse
of the wretched Nerio, when the Venetian envoy to the new Sultan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Mohammed II, is instructed to ask that potentate if he will compel his
vassal, “the lord of Sithines and Stives,” to settle the pecuniary claims
of two Venetians<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>Nerio’s death was followed by one of those tragedies in which the
women of Frankish Greece were so often protagonists, and of which a
modern dramatist might well avail himself. After the death of his first
wife, Nerio II had married a passionate Venetian beauty, Chiara Zorzi,
or Giorgio, one of the daughters of the baron of Karystos, or Castel Rosso,
in the south of Eubœa, who sprang from the former Marquesses of
Boudonitza. The Duchess Chiara bore him a son, Francesco, who was
unfortunately still a minor at the time of his father’s death. The child’s
mother possessed herself of the regency and persuaded the Porte, by the
usual methods, to sanction her usurpation. Soon afterwards, however,
there visited Athens on some commercial errand a young Venetian noble,
Bartolommeo Contarini, whose father had been governor of the Venetian
colony of Nauplia. The Duchess fell in love with her charming visitor,
and bade him aspire to her hand and land. Contarini replied that alas!
he had left a wife behind him in his palace on the lagoons. To the Lady of
the Akropolis, a figure who might have stepped from a play of Æschylus,
the Venetian wife was no obstacle. It was the age of great crimes.
Contarini realised that Athens was worth a murder, poisoned his spouse,
and returned to enjoy the embraces and the authority of the Duchess.</p>

<p>But the Athenians soon grew tired of this Venetian domination.
They complained to Mohammed II; the great Sultan demanded explanations;
and Contarini was forced to appear with his stepson, whose
guardian he pretended to be, at the Turkish Court. There he found a
dangerous rival in the person of Franco Acciajuoli, only son of the late
Duke Antonio II and cousin of Francesco, a special favourite of
Mohammed and a willing candidate for the Athenian throne. When the
Sultan heard the tragic story of Chiara’s passion, he ordered the
deposition of both herself and her husband, and bade the Athenians
accept Franco as their lord. Young Francesco was never heard of again.
But the tragedy was not yet over. Franco had no sooner assumed the
government of Athens than he ordered the arrest of his aunt Chiara,
threw her into the dungeons of Megara, and there had her mysteriously
murdered. A picturesque legend current three centuries later at Athens
makes Franco throttle her with his own hands as she knelt invoking the
aid of the Virgin, and then cut off her head with his sword<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>; so deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
was the impression which her fate made upon the popular imagination.</p>

<p>The legend tells us how her husband, “the Admiral,” had come with
many ships to the Piræus to rescue her, but arrived too late. Unable to
save, he resolved to avenge her, and laid the grim facts before the Sultan.
Mohammed II, indignant at the conduct of his <i>protégé</i>, but not sorry,
perhaps, of a pretext for destroying the remnants of Frankish rule at
Athens, ordered Omar, son of Tourakhan, the governor of Thessaly, to
march against the city. The lower town offered no resistance, for its
modern walls had but a narrow circumference, and its population and
resources were scanty. Nature herself seemed to fight against the
Athenians. On May 29, the third anniversary of the capture of Constantinople,
a comet appeared in the sky; a dire famine followed, so
that the people were reduced to eat roots and grass. On June 4, 1456,
the town fell into the hands of the Turks<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. But the Akropolis, which was
reputed impregnable, long held out. In vain the Constable of Athens
and some of the citizens offered the castle to Venice through one of the
Zorzi family; the Republic ordered the bailie of Negroponte to keep the
offer open, but took no steps to save the most famous fortress in Christendom;
in vain he summoned one Latin prince after another to his aid.
From the presence of an Athenian ambassador at the Neapolitan Court<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
we may infer that Alfonso V of Aragon, the titular “Duke of Athens,”
was among their number. The papal fleet, which was despatched to the
Ægean, did not even put into the Piræus. Meanwhile Omar, after a vain
attempt to seduce the garrison from its allegiance, reminded Franco
that sooner or later he must restore Athens to the Sultan who gave
it. “Now, therefore,” added the Turkish commander, “if thou wilt
surrender the Akropolis, His Majesty offers thee the land of Bœotia,
with the city of Thebes, and will allow thee to take away the wealth of
the Akropolis and thine own property.” Franco only waited till
Mohammed had confirmed the offer of his subordinate, and then quitted
the castle of Athens, with his wife and his three sons, for ever. At the
same time the last Catholic archbishop, Nicolò Protimo of Eubœa, left
the cathedral of Our Lady. It was not till 1875 that a Latin prelate again
resided at Athens.</p>

<p>The great Sultan, so his Greek biographer, Kritoboulos, tells us, was
filled with a desire to see the city of the philosophers. Mohammed knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Greek, and had heard and read much about the wisdom and marvellous
works of the ancient Athenians; we may surmise that Cyriacus of Ancona
had told him of the Athenian monuments when he was employed as
reader to his Majesty during the siege of Constantinople<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. This strange
“Philhellene”—for so Kritoboulos audaciously describes the conqueror
of Hellas—longed to visit the places where the heroes and sages of
classic Athens had walked and talked, and at the same time to examine,
with a statesman’s eye, the position of the city and the condition of its
harbours. In the autumn of 1458, on his return from punishing the Greek
Despots of the Morea, he had an opportunity of achieving his wish.
When he arrived at the gates (if we may believe a much later tradition<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>),
the Abbot of Kaisariane, the monastery which still nestles in one of the
folds of Hymettos, handed him the keys of the city. There is nothing
improbable in the story, for the Greek Metropolitan, Isidore, had fled
to the Venetian Island of Tenos; and the abbot may therefore have been
the most important Greek dignitary left at Athens. The Sultan devoted
four days to visiting his new possession, “of all the cities in his Empire
the dearest to him,” as the Athenian Chalkokondyles proudly says. But
of all that he saw he admired most the Akropolis, whose ancient and
recent buildings he examined “with the eyes of a scholar, a Philhellene,
and a great sovereign.” Like Pedro IV of Aragon before him, he was
proud to possess such a jewel, and in his enthusiasm he exclaimed, “How
much, indeed, do we not owe to Omar, the son of Tourakhan!”</p>

<p>The conquered Athenians were once again saved by their ancestors.
Like his Roman prototype, Mohammed II treated them humanely,
granted all their petitions, and gave them many and various privileges.
So late as the seventeenth century there were Athenians who could show
patents of fiscal exemption, issued to their forebears by the conqueror.
If, however, the Greek clergy had hoped that the great cathedral would
be restored to the Orthodox church, they were disappointed. The
Parthenon, by a third transformation, was converted into a mosque;
and soon, from the tapering minaret which rose above it, the muezzin
summoned the faithful to the <i>Ismaïdi</i>, or “house of prayer.” A like
fate befell the church which had served as the Orthodox cathedral
during the Frankish domination, but which received, in honour of the
Sultan’s visit, the name of <i>Fethijeh Jamisi</i>, or “Mosque of the Conqueror,”
and which still preserves, amid the squalid surroundings of the
military bakery, the traces of its former purpose.</p>

<p>The anonymous treatise on “The Theatres and Schools of Athens,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
which was probably composed by some Greek at this moment, perhaps
to serve as a guide-book for the distinguished visitor, gives us a last
glimpse of Frankish Athens. The choragic monument of Lysikrates was
still known as “the lantern of Demosthenes”; the Tower of the Winds
was supposed to be “the School of Sokrates”; the gate of Athena
Archegetis was transformed in common parlance into “the palace of
Themistokles”; the Odeion of Perikles was called “the School of
Aristophanes”; and that of Herodes Atticus was divided into “the
palaces of Kleonides and Miltiades.” The spots where once had stood the
houses of Thucydides, Solon, and Alkmaion were well known to the
omniscient local antiquary, who unhesitatingly converts the Temple of
Wingless Victory into “a small school of musicians, founded by Pythagoras.”</p>

<p>On the fifth day after his arrival the heir of these great men left
Athens for Thebes, the abode of his vassal Franco, who must have
heaved a sigh of relief when his terrible visitor, after a minute examination
of Bœotia, set out for Macedonia. For two years longer he managed
to retain his Theban dominions, from which he received a revenue as
large as that which he had formerly enjoyed, till, in 1460, Mohammed,
after finally destroying the two Greek principalities of the Morea,
revisited Athens. There the Sultan heard a rumour that some Athenians
had conspired to restore their Florentine lord. This decided Franco’s
fate. At the moment he was serving, as the man of the Turk, with a
regiment of Bœotian cavalry in Mohammed’s camp. His suzerain
ordered him to join in an attack which he meditated upon the surviving
fragments of the ancient county of Cephalonia, the domain of the
Tocchi. Franco shrank from fighting against his fellow-countryman;
and a curious letter has recently been published<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> in which, for this very
reason, he offered his services as a <i>condottiere</i> to Francesco Sforza of
Milan for the sum of 10,000 ducats a year. But he was forced to obey;
he did his pitiable task, and repaired to the headquarters of Zagan
Pasha, the governor of the Morea, unconscious that the latter had orders
to kill him. The Pasha invited him to his tent, where he detained him in
conversation till nightfall; but, as the unsuspecting Frank was on his
way back to his own pavilion, the governor’s guards seized and strangled
him. Such was the sorry end of the last “Lord of Thebes.” Mohammed
annexed all Bœotia, and thus obliterated the last trace of the Duchy of
Athens.</p>

<p>Franco’s three sons were enrolled in the corps of janissaries, where
one of them showed military and administrative ability of so high an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
order as to win the favour of his sovereign. Their mother, a Greek of
noble lineage and famed for her beauty, became the cause of a terrible
tragedy which convulsed alike Court and Church. Amoiroutses, the
former minister and betrayer of the Greek Empire of Trebizond, fell
desperately in love with the fair widow, to whom he addressed impassioned
verses, and swore, though he was already married, to wed her
or die. The Œcumenical Patriarch forbade the banns, and lost his beard
and his office rather than yield to the Sultan. But swift retribution fell
upon the bigamist, for he dropped down dead, a dice-box in his hand.</p>

<p>Though the Acciajuoli dynasty had thus fallen for ever, members of
that great family still remained in Greece. An Acciajuoli was made civil
governor of the old Venetian colony of Koron, in Messenia, when the
Spaniards conquered it from the Turks in 1532. When they abandoned
it, he was captured by pirates but eventually ransomed, only to die
in poverty at Naples, where his race had first risen to eminence. At the
beginning of the last century the French traveller, Pouqueville, was
shown at Athens a donkey-driver named Neri, in whose veins flowed the
blood of the Florentine Dukes; and the modern historian of Christian
Athens, Neroutsos, used to contend that his family was descended from
Nerozzo Pitti, lord of Sykaminon and uncle of the last Duke of Athens.
In Florence the family became extinct only so recently as 1834; and the
Certosa and the Lung’ Arno Acciajuoli still preserve its memory there.
In a Florentine gallery are two coloured portraits of the Dukes of
Athens, which would seem to be those of Nerio I and the bastard
Antonio I. In that case the Florentine Dukes of Athens are the only
Frankish rulers of Greece, except the Palatine Counts of Cephalonia,
whose likeness has been preserved to posterity<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus ended the strange connection between Florence and Athens.
A titular Duke of Athens had become tyrant of the Florentines, a
Florentine merchant had become Duke of Athens; but the age when
French and Italian adventurers could find an El Dorado on the poetic
soil of Greece was over. The dull uniformity of Turkish rule spread over
the land, save where the Dukes of the Archipelago and the Venetian
colonies still remained the sole guardians of Western culture, the only
rays of light in the once brilliant Latin Orient.</p>

<h4 id="heading8">APPENDIX<br />
NOTES ON ATHENS UNDER THE FRANKS</h4>

<p>Within the last sixteen years a great deal of new material has
been published on the subject of Frankish Athens. The late Professor
Lampros<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> not only translated into Greek the <i>Geschichte der Stadt
Athen im Mittelalter</i> of Gregorovius, but added some most valuable
notes, and more than a whole volume of documents, some of which had
never seen the light before, while others were known only in the summaries
or extracts of Hopf, Gregorovius, or Signor Predelli. He also
issued a review, the Νέος Ἑλληνομνήμων, devoted to mediæval Greek
history, of which thirteen volumes have appeared. The French have gone
on printing the <i>Regesta</i> of the thirteenth-century popes, which contain
occasional allusions to Greek affairs. Don Antonio Rubió y Lluch, the
Catalan scholar, has issued a valuable pamphlet, <i>Catalunya a Grecia</i><a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>,
besides contributing a mass of documents from the archives at Palermo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
to the collection of Professor Lampros; and the essay on the “Eastern
Policy of Alfonso of Aragon,” published by Signor Cerone in the <i>Archivio
Storico per le province Napoletane</i><a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>, contains many hitherto unknown
documents dealing with the last two decades of Greek history before the
Turkish conquest. I propose in the present article to point out the most
important additions to our knowledge of Athens under her western
masters which have thus been obtained. Of the condition of the
Parthenon—“Our Lady of Athens”—on the eve of the Frankish conquest
we have some interesting evidence. We learn from an iambic poem
of Michael Akominatos, the Greek Metropolitan of Athens, that he
“beautified the church, presented new vessels and furniture for its use,
increased the number of the clergy, and added to the estates” of the
great cathedral, as well as to the “flocks and herds” which belonged to
it. Every year a great festival attracted the Greeks from far and near to
the shrine of the “Virgin of Athens<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.”</p>

<p>As was only to be expected, very little fresh light has been thrown on
the Burgundian period. We learn however, from a Greek manuscript in
the Vatican library, how Leon Sgouros, the <i>archon</i> of Nauplia, who long
held out at Akrocorinth against the Frankish conquerors, met his end.
Rather than be taken captive “he mounted his horse and leapt from
Akrocorinth, so that not a single bone in his body was left unbroken<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.”
We find too, in a letter from Honorius III to Othon de la Roche, dated
February 12, 1225, the last allusion to the presence of the <i>Megaskyr</i> in
his Athenian dominions before his return to France; and we hear of two
members of his family, William and Nicholas, both canons of Athens. The
former had <i>gravem in litteratura defectum</i>, or else he would have been
made archbishop of Athens; the latter is probably the same person whose
name has been found on the stoa of Hadrian<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>The Catalan period receives much more illustration. We know at last
the exact date at which it ended, for a letter of Jacopo da Prato (probably
a relative of the Ludovico da Prato who was the first Florentine
archbishop of Athens), dated Patras, May 9, 1388, announces that Nerio
Acciajuoli <i>ebe adi 2 di questo lo chastello di Settino</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. Thus Don Antonio
Rubió y Lluch<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> was right in his surmise that Don Pedro de Pau, who is
mentioned as erroneously reported dead in a letter of John I of Aragon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
dated November 16, 1387, held out in the Akropolis down to 1388. The
Catalan scholar had shown that the brave commander of “the Castle
of Athens” had sent an envoy to John I, who received him “in the lesser
palace of Barcelona” on March 18, 1387, and who promised the <i>sindici</i>
of Athens on April 26 to pay a speedy visit to his distant duchy<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. Don
Antonio Rubió y Lluch also writes to me that Hopf was mistaken in
translating <i>Petrus de Puteo</i> of the Sicilian documents—the official whose
high-handed proceedings led to a revolution at Thebes in which he, his
wife, and his chief followers lost their lives—as Peter de Puig<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. His
name should really be Peter de Pou, and it is obvious from the documents
that Hopf’s chronology of his career is also wrong. He is mentioned in
a document of August 3, 1366, as already dead<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; we learn that his official
title was “vicar of the duchies”—that is to say, deputy for Matteo de
Moncada, the absent vicar-general—and he is spoken of as “having
presided in the duchies as vicar-general,” and as “having presided in the
office of the vicariate<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.” We find too that the castle of Zeitoun or Lamia
(<i>turrim Griffinam</i>) belonged to him<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. Roger de Lluria, who was at this
time marshal of the duchies<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, is already officially styled as vicar-general<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
on August 3, 1366, though the formal commission removing Matteo de
Moncada and appointing Roger de Lluria in his place was not made out
till May 14 of the following year<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. The new vicar-general held till his
death, which must have taken place before March 31, 1370, when his
successor was appointed<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>, the two great offices<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, and, I think, the facts
above stated enable us to explain the reason why no more marshals
were appointed after that date. The office of marshal had been hereditary
in the family of De Novelles, and Gregorovius<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> pointed out that
Ermengol de Novelles did not (as Hopf imagined) hold it till his death,
but that Roger de Lluria was marshal before that event. I should
suppose that Ermengol had been deprived of the office as a punishment
for his rebellion against his sovereign<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>; that the conflict between Lluria
and Pou proved that there was no room in the narrow court of Thebes
for two such exalted officials as a vicar and a marshal; and, as Lluria,
when he became vicar, combined the two offices in his person, it was
thought a happy solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Professor Lampros has published three documents<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> from the Vatican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
archives which refer to a mysterious scheme for the marriage of a
Sicilian duchess of Athens. The documents have no date, except the day
of the month, and in one case of the week, and one of them is partly in
cypher. But I think that I have succeeded in fixing the exact date of the
first to January 4, 1369, because in 1368, December 22 was on a Friday.
This suits all the historical facts mentioned. The bishop of Cambrai, to
whom the second letter is addressed, must be Robert of Geneva (afterwards
the anti-pope Clement VII), who occupied that see from October
11, 1368, to June 6, 1371. The <i>dominus Anghia</i>, whose death has so much
disturbed the diocese, is Sohier d’Enghien, who was beheaded in 1367;
the <i>comes Litii</i> is his brother Jean, count of Lecce, and the latter’s
nephew, whose marriage “with the young niece of the king of Sicily,
daughter of a former Catalan duke of Athens,” is considered suitable,
is Gautier III, titular duke of Athens, who had inherited the claims of
the Brienne family. The lady whose marriage is the object of all these
negotiations must therefore have been one of the two daughters of John,
Marquis of Randazzo and Duke of Athens and Neopatras, who died in
1348, and whose youngest child, Constance, may therefore have been
<i>xx annorum et ultra</i> at this period, and is known to have been single.
She was the niece of King Peter II and cousin of Frederick III of Sicily,
one of whose sisters is described as too old for the titular duke, which
would of course have been the case in 1369. The allusions to Philip II
of Taranto as still living also fix the date as before the close of 1373,
when he died. Moreover Archbishop Simon of Thebes is known to have
been in Sicily in 1367, and may have remained there longer. What was
apparently an insuperable chronological obstacle, the allusion to <i>obitum
domini regis Franciæ</i>, disappeared when I examined the original document
in the Vatican library and found that the last two words were <i>regie
fameie</i>, that is, <i>familiæ</i>. Possibly the allusion may be to Pedro the Cruel
of Castile, who was slain in 1369. The letters then disclose a matrimonial
alliance which would have reconciled the Athenian claims of the house
of Enghien with the ducal dominion over Catalan Athens exercised by
Frederick III of Sicily.</p>

<p>Don Antonio Rubió y Lluch has published two letters<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> of “the queen
of Aragon,” wife of Pedro IV (not, as assumed by K. Konstantinides,
Maria, queen of Sicily and duchess of Athens), from the former of which,
dated 1379 and addressed to Archbishop Ballester of Athens, we glean
some curious information about the relics which the cathedral of <i>Santa
Maria de Setines</i> (the Parthenon) then contained, and of which the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
traveller Nicolò da Martoni made out a list sixteen years later<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. The
Catalan scholar has shown too that some years after the Florentine
conquest of Athens a certain Bertranet, <i>un dels majors capitans del ducat
d’Atenes</i>, recovered a place where was the head of St George, that is to
say, Livadia<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. The personage mentioned is Bertranet Mota, whose name
occurs in the treaty with the Navarrese in 1390, as a witness to another
document in the same year, in the list of fiefs in 1391, in Nerio Acciajuoli’s
will, and in a letter of the bishop of Argos in 1394. He was a friend of
Nerio’s bastard, Antonio; he had obviously helped the latter to recover
Livadia from the Turks in 1393, and we are thus able to reconcile
Chalkokondyles, who says that Bayezid had already annexed Livadia,
with the clause in Nerio’s will leaving the important fortress to Antonio<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.
More interesting still, as showing the tenacity with which the kings of
Aragon clung to the shadow of their rule over Athens, is the letter of
Alfonso V to the despot Constantine Palaiologos (afterwards the last
emperor of Constantinople), dated November 27, 1444, in which the king
says that he has heard that Constantine has occupied Athens, and therefore
requests him to hand over the two duchies of Athens and Neopatras
to the Marquess of Gerace, his emissary<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, to our knowledge of the Florentine period Professor Lampros
has contributed three letters<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> of the Athenian priest and copyist
Kalophrenas, which show that the attempts of the council of Florence for
the union of the eastern and western churches found an echo in Florentine
Athens. Professor Lampros was puzzled to explain the allusion
to τοῦ ἀφεντὸς τοῦ μπαὴλου in one of the letters. He thinks it alludes to
the Venetian bailie at Chalkis, who however had no jurisdiction at Athens
at that period. If however, as he supposes, the correspondence dates
from 1441 the phrase presents no difficulty. In that year Antonio II
Acciajuoli had died, leaving an infant son, Franco, then absent at the
Turkish court, and Nerio II, the former duke, returned to Athens. We
may therefore suppose that “the prince’s baily” was the official who
governed Athens till Nerio II came back. Professor Lampros has also
published a letter<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> of Franco, the last duke of Athens, to Francesco
Sforza of Milan, dated 1460, from Thebes, which Mohammed II had
allowed him to retain after the capture of Athens in 1456. In this letter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
written not long before his murder, Franco offers his services as a <i>condottiere</i>
to the duke of Milan. This was not his only negotiation with
western potentates, for only a few days before the loss of Athens an
ambassador of his was at the Neapolitan court<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.</p>

<p>One mistake has escaped the notice of Professor Lampros, as of his
predecessors. The date of the second visit of Cyriacus of Ancona to
Athens, when he found Nerio II on the Akropolis, must have been 1444
and not 1447, because the antiquary’s letter from Chios is dated
<i>Kyriaceo die iv. Kal. Ap.</i> Now, March 29 fell on a Sunday in 1444, and
we know from another letter of Cyriacus to the emperor John VI,
written before June 1444, that he left Chalkis for Chios on <i>v. Kal. Mart.</i>
of that year.</p>

<h4 id="heading9">THE TURKISH CAPTURE OF ATHENS</h4>

<p>The authorities differ as to the exact date of the capture of Athens
by the Turks. A contemporary note in Manuscript No. 103 of the
Liturgical Section of the National Library at Athens, quoted by
Kampouroglos<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>, fixes it at “May 4, 1456, Friday”; but in that year
<i>June</i> 4, not May 4, was a Friday, which agrees with the date of June
1456, given by Phrantzes<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, the <i>Chronicon Breve</i><a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>, and the <i>Historia
Patriarchica</i><a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. But the best evidence in favour of June is the following
document of 1458, to which allusion was made by Gaddi<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> in the seventeenth
century, but which has never been published. I owe the copy to
the courtesy of the Director of the “Archivio di Stato” at Florence.</p>

<p>The petitioners in the document are all well known. Nerozzo Pitti
and his wife Laudamia owned the castle of Sykaminon, near Oropos,
which had belonged to her father, Franco Acciajuoli<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. She was the aunt
of the last two dukes of Athens. Pitti also possessed the island of Panaia,
or Canaia, the ancient Pyrrha, opposite the mouth of the Maliac Gulf,
and his “dignified tenure” of those two places is praised by Baphius
in his treatise <i>De Felicitate Urbis Florentiæ</i><a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>, a century later. According
to the contemporary chronicler, Benedetto Dei<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, the Athenian Pitti were
compelled to become Mohammedans when Bœotia was annexed; but
the late historian Neroutsos used to maintain his descent from Nerozzo.</p>

<h3 id="heading10">6. THE DUCHY OF NAXOS</h3>

<p>Of all the strange and romantic creations of the Middle Ages none
is so curious as the capture of the poetic “Isles of Greece” by a
handful of Venetian adventurers, and their organisation as a Latin
Duchy for upwards of three centuries. Even to-day the traces of the
ducal times may be found in many of the Cyclades, where Latin families,
descendants of the conquerors, still preserve the high-sounding names
and the Catholic religion of their Italian ancestors, in the midst of ruined
palaces and castles, built by the mediæval lords of the Archipelago out
of ancient Hellenic temples. But of the Duchy of Naxos little is generally
known. Its picturesque history, upon which Finlay touched rather
slightly in his great work, has since then been thoroughly explored by a
laborious German, the late Dr Hopf; but that lynx-eyed student of
archives had no literary gifts; he could not write, he could only read, and
his researches lie buried in a ponderous encyclopædia. So this delightful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Duchy, whose whole story is one long romance, still awaits the hand of a
novelist to make it live again.</p>

<p>The origin of this fantastic State of the blue Ægean is to be found
in the overthrow of the Greek Empire at the time of the Fourth Crusade.
By the partition treaty made between the Latin conquerors of Constantinople,
Venice received the Cyclades among other acquisitions.
But the Venetian Government, with its usual commercial astuteness,
soon came to the conclusion that the conquest of those islands would too
severely tax the resources of the State. It was therefore decided to leave
the task of occupying them to private citizens, who would plant
Venetian colonies in the Ægean, and live on friendly terms with the
Republic. There was no lack of enterprise among the Venetians of that
generation, and it so happened that at that very moment the Venetian
colony at Constantinople contained the very man for such an undertaking.
The old Doge, Dandolo, had taken with him on the crusade his
nephew, Marco Sanudo, a bold warrior and a skilful diplomatist, who
had signalised himself by negotiating the sale of Crete to the Republic,
and was then filling the post of judge in what we should now call the
Consular Court at Constantinople. On hearing the decision of his
Government, Sanudo quitted the bench, gathered round him a band of
adventurous spirits, to whom he promised rich fiefs in the El Dorado of
the Ægean, equipped eight galleys at his own cost, and sailed with them
to carve out a Duchy for himself in the islands of the Archipelago.
Seventeen islands speedily submitted, and at one spot alone did he meet
with any real resistance. Naxos has always been the pearl of the Ægean:
poets have placed there the beautiful myth of Ariadne and Dionysos;
Herodotos describes it as “excelling the other islands in prosperity<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>”;
even to-day, when so many of the Cyclades are barren rocks, the orange
and lemon groves of Naxos entitle it, far more than Zante, to the proud
name of “flower of the Levant.” This was the island which now
opposed the Venetian filibuster, as centuries before it had opposed the
Persians. A body of Genoese pirates had occupied the Byzantine
castle before Sanudo’s arrival; but that shrewd leader, who knew the
value of rashness in an emergency, burnt his galleys, and then bade his
companions conquer or die. The castle surrendered after a five weeks’
siege, so that by 1207 Sanudo had conquered a duchy which existed for
359 years. His duchy included, besides Naxos, where he fixed his
capital, the famous marble island of Paros; Kimolos, celebrated for its
fuller’s earth; Melos, whose sad fortunes furnished Thucydides with one
of the most curious passages in his history; and Syra, destined at a much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
later date to be the most important of all the Cyclades. True to his
promise, Sanudo divided some of his conquests among his companions;
thus, Andros and the volcanic island of Santorin became sub-fiefs of the
Duchy. Sanudo himself did homage, not to Venice, but to the Emperor
Henry of Romania, who formally bestowed upon him “the Duchy of the
Dodekannesos,” or Archipelago, on the freest possible tenure. Having
thus arranged the constitution of his little State, he proceeded to restore
the ancient city; to build himself a castle, which commanded his capital
and which is now in ruins; to erect a Catholic cathedral, on which, in
spite of its restoration in the seventeenth century, his arms may still
be seen; to improve the harbour by the construction of a mole; and to
fortify the town with solid masonry, of which one fragment stands to-day,
a monument, like the Santameri tower at Thebes, of Frank rule in
Greece.</p>

<p>As we might expect from so shrewd a statesman, the founder of
this island-duchy was fully sensible of the advantages to be derived from
having the Greeks on his side. Instead of treating them as serfs and
schismatics, he allowed all those who did not intrigue against him with
the Greek potentates at Trebizond, Nice, or Arta, to retain their
property. He guaranteed the free exercise of their religion, nor did he
allow the Catholic archbishop, sent him by the Pope, to persecute the
Orthodox clergy or their flocks. The former imperial domains were
confiscated, in order to provide and maintain a new fleet, so necessary
to the existence of islands menaced by pirates. That Marco I was a
powerful and wealthy ruler is proved not only by his buildings, but also
by the value set upon his aid. When the Cretans had risen, as they so
often did, against the Venetians, the Governor sent in hot haste to Naxos
for Marco’s assistance. The Duke was still a citizen of the Republic; but
the Governor knew his man, and stimulated his patriotism by the offer
of lands in Crete. Marco lost no time in appearing upon the scene,
defeated the insurgents, and claimed his reward. The Governor was also
a Venetian, and not over-desirous of parting with his lands now that the
danger seemed to be over. But Marco knew his Greeks by this time, and
readily entered into a plot with a Cretan chief for the conquest of the
island. Candia was speedily his, while the Governor had to escape in
woman’s clothes to the fortress of Temenos. But, just as he seemed
likely to annex Crete to his Duchy, Venetian reinforcements arrived.
Unable to carry out his design, he yet succeeded by his diplomacy in
securing an amnesty and pecuniary compensation, with which he
retired to his island domain. But the failure of his Cretan adventure did
not in the least damp his ardour. With only eight ships he boldly attacked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
the squadron of the Emperor of Nice, nearly four times as numerous.
Captured and carried as a prisoner to the Nicene Court, he so greatly
impressed the Emperor by his courage and manly beauty that the latter
ordered his release, and gave him one of the princesses of the imperial
house in marriage. In short, his career was that of a typical Venetian
adventurer, brave, hard-headed, selfish, and unscrupulous; in fact, just
the sort of man to found a dynasty in a part of the world where cleverness
counts for more than heroic simplicity of character.</p>

<p>During the long and peaceful reign of his son Angelo, little occurred
to disturb the progress of the Duchy. But its external relations underwent
a change at this time, in consequence of the transference of the
suzerainty over it from the weak Emperor of Romania to the powerful
Prince of Achaia, Geoffroy II, as a reward for Geoffroy’s assistance in
defending the Latin Empire against the Greeks. Angelo, too, equipped
three galleys for the defence of Constantinople, and, after its fall, sent
a handsome present to the exiled Emperor. Like his father, he was
summoned to aid the Venetian Governor of Crete against the native
insurgents, but on the approach of the Nicene fleet he cautiously withdrew.
His son, Marco II, who succeeded him in 1262, found himself face
to face with a more difficult situation than that which had prevailed in
the times of his father and grandfather. The Greeks had recovered
ground not only at Constantinople, but in the south-east of the Morea,
and their successes were repeated on a smaller scale in the Archipelago.
Licario, the Byzantine admiral, captured many of the Ægean islands,
some of which remained thenceforth part of the imperial dominions.
Besides the Sanudi, the dynasty of the Ghisi, lords of Tenos and
Mykonos, alone managed to hold its own against the Greek invasion;
yet even the Ghisi suffered considerably from the attacks of the redoubtable
admiral. One member of that family was fond of applying
to himself the Ovidian line, “I am too big a man to be harmed by
fortune,” and his subjects on the island of Skopelos, which has lately
been notorious as the place of exile of Royalist politicians, used to boast
that, even if the whole realm of Romania fell, they would escape
destruction. But Licario, who knew that Skopelos lacked water,
invested it during a hot summer, forced it to capitulate, and sent the
haughty Ghisi in chains to Constantinople. Marco II had to quell an
insurrection of the Greeks at Melos, who thought that the time had come
for shaking off the Latin yoke. Educated at the court of Guillaume de
Villehardouin, Marco had imbibed the resolute methods of that energetic
prince, and he soon showed that he did not intend to relax his hold on
what his grandfather had seized. Aided by a body of Frank fugitives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
from Constantinople, he reduced the rebels to submission, and pardoned
all of them with the exception of a Greek priest whom he suspected of
being the cause of the revolt. This man he is said to have ordered to be
bound hand and foot, and then thrown into the harbour of Melos.</p>

<p>Towards the orthodox clergy Marco II was, if we may believe the
Jesuit historian of the Duchy, by no means so tolerant as his two
predecessors<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>. There was, it seems, in the island of Naxos an altar
dedicated to St Pachys, a portly man of God, who was believed by the
devout Naxiotes to have the power of making their children fat. In the
East fatness is still regarded as a mark of comeliness, and in the thirteenth
century St Pachys was a very popular personage, whose altar was
visited by loving mothers, and whose hierophants lived upon the
credulity of the faithful. Marco II regarded this institution as a gross
superstition. Had he been a wise statesman, he would have tolerated it
all the same, and allowed the matrons of Naxos to shove their offspring
through the hollow altar of the fat saint, so long as no harm ensued to
his State. But Marco II was not wise; he smashed the altar, and thereby
so irritated his Orthodox subjects that he had to build a fortress to keep
them in order. But the Greeks were not the only foes who menaced the
Duchy at this period. The Archipelago had again become the happy
hunting-ground of pirates of all nationalities—Greek corsairs from the
impregnable rock of Monemvasia or from the islands of Santorin and
Keos, Latins like Roger de Lluria, the famous Sicilian admiral, who
preyed on their fellow-religionists, mongrels who combined the vices of
both their parents. The first place among the pirates of the time belonged
to the Genoese, the natural rivals of the Venetians in the Levant, and
on that account popular with the Greek islanders. No sooner was a
Genoese galley spied in the offing than the peasants would hurry down
with provisions to the beach, just as the Calabrian peasants have been
known to give food to notorious brigands. The result of these visitations
on the smaller islands may be easily imagined: thus the inhabitants of
Amorgos emigrated in a body to Naxos from fear of the corsairs; yet,
in spite of the harm inflicted by Licario and the pirates, we are told that
the fertile plain of Drymalia, in the interior of Naxos, “then contained
twelve large villages, a number of farm buildings, country houses and
towers, with about 10,000 inhabitants.” Sometimes the remote consequences
of the pirates’ raids were worse than the raids themselves.
Thus, on one of these expeditions, some corsairs carried off a valuable
ass belonging to one of the Ghisi. The ass, marked with its master’s
initials, was bought by Marco II’s son, Guglielmo, who lived at Syra.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
The purchaser was under no illusions as to the ownership of the ass, but
was perfectly aware that he was buying stolen goods. Seeing this, Ghisi
invaded Syra, laid the island waste, and besieged Sanudo in his castle.
But the fate of the ass had aroused wide sympathies. Marco II had taken
the oath of fealty to Charles of Anjou, as suzerain of Achaia, after the
death of his liege lord, Guillaume de Villehardouin, and it chanced that
the Angevin admiral was cruising in the Archipelago at the time of the
rape of the ass. Feudal law compelled him to assist the son of his
master’s vassal; a lady’s prayers conquered any hesitation that he might
have felt; so he set sail for Syra, where he soon forced Ghisi to raise the
siege. The great ass case was then submitted to the decision of the
Venetian bailie in Eubœa, who restored the peace of the Levant, but
only after “more than 30,000 heavy soldi” had been expended for the
sake of the ass!</p>

<p>After the recapture of Constantinople by the Greeks, the policy of
Venice towards the dukes underwent a change. As we have seen,
neither the founder of the Duchy nor his son and grandson were vassals
of the Republic, though they were all three Venetian citizens. But the
Venetian Government, alarmed at the commercial privileges accorded to
its great rivals, the Genoese, by the Byzantine Emperor, now sought to
obtain a stronger military and commercial position in the Archipelago,
and, if possible, to acquire direct authority over the Duchy. An excuse
for the attempt was offered by the affairs of Andros. That island had
been bestowed by Marco I as a sub-fief of Naxos upon Marino Dandolo.
Marco II resumed immediate possession of it after the death of Dandolo’s
widow, and refused to grant her half of the island to her son by a second
marriage, Nicolò Quirini, on the plausible plea that he arrived to do
homage after the term allowed by the feudal law had expired. But
Quirini was a Venetian bailie, and accordingly appealed to Venice for
justice. The Doge summoned Marco II to make defence before the Senate;
but Marco replied that Venice was not his suzerain, that the ducal Court
at Naxos, and not the Senate at Venice, was the proper tribunal to
try the case, and that he would be happy to afford the claimant all
proper facilities for pleading his cause if he would appear there. The
question then dropped; Marco remained in possession of Andros, while
the Republic waited for a more favourable opportunity of advancing its
political interests in the Archipelago.</p>

<p>This opportunity was not long in coming. Towards the end of the
thirteenth century a violent war broke out between Venice and her
Genoese rivals, supported by the Byzantine Emperor. While the Genoese
tried to undermine Venetian power in Crete, Venice let loose a new swarm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
of privateers on the islands of the Ægean, which Licario had recovered
for the Byzantines. Then for the first time we meet with the word
<i>armatoloí</i>, so famous in the later history of Greece, applied originally to
the outfitters, or <i>armatores</i>, of privateers. The dispossessed Venetian
lords were thus enabled to reconquer many of the possessions which
they had then lost; Amorgos, the birthplace of Simonides, was restored
to the Ghisi, Santorin and Therasia to the Barozzi, but only on condition
that they recognised the suzerainty of the Republic. This arrangement
was contested by the Duke of the Archipelago, on the ground that
those islands had originally been sub-fiefs of his ancestors’ dominions.
Guglielmo Sanudo, the purchaser of the ass, had now succeeded to the
Duchy, and, as might have been inferred from that story, was not likely
to be over-scrupulous in his methods. As one of the Barozzi declined to
do him homage, he had him arrested by corsairs on the high seas, and
threw him into the ducal dungeon at Naxos. This was more than Venice
could stand, for this scion of the Barozzi had been Venetian governor of
Candia. An ultimatum was therefore despatched to the Duke, bidding
him send his captive to Eubœa within eight days, under pain of being
treated as a pirate. This message had the desired effect. Guglielmo let
his prisoner go, and it was seen that the name of Venice was more
powerful than before in the Archipelago. But neither Venice nor the
Duke could prevent the increasing desolation of the islands. The Catalans
had now appeared in the Levant; in 1303 they ravaged Keos; after their
establishment in the Duchy of Athens they organised a raid on Melos,
from which, like the Athenians of old, they carried off numbers of the
inhabitants as slaves. A Spaniard from Coruña, Januli da Corogna,
occupied Siphnos, and two of the leading families in Santorin to-day are
of Catalan origin. A member of one of them, Dr De Cigalla, or Dekigallas,
as he is called in Greek, is a voluminous author, and a great authority on
the eruptions of that volcanic island. Turkish squadrons completed the
work of destruction; we hear of a new exodus from Amorgos in consequence
of their depredations, but this time the frightened islanders
preferred to seek refuge under the Venetian banner in Crete rather than
in Naxos. The latter island was, indeed, no longer so secure as it had
been. True, Duke Guglielmo had welcomed the establishment of the
warlike knights of St John at Rhodes, and had helped them to conquer
that stronghold, in the hope that they would be able to ward off the
Turks from his dominions. Venice, too, had come to see that her wisest
policy was to strengthen the Naxiote Duchy, and furnished both the next
Dukes, Nicolò I and Giovanni I, with arms for its protection. But, all
the same, in 1344 the dreaded Turks effected a landing on Naxos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
occupied the capital, and dragged away 6000 of the islanders to captivity.
This misfortune increased the panic of the peasants throughout the
Archipelago. They fled in greater numbers than ever to Crete, so that
Giovanni complained at Venice of the depopulation of his islands, and
asked for leave to bring back the emigrants. Even the fine island of
Andros, which had formerly produced more wheat and barley than it
could consume, was now forced to import grain from Eubœa, while many
of the proprietors in other parts of the Ægean had to procure labour
from the Morea. In fact, towards the middle of the fourteenth century,
such security as existed in the Levant was due solely to the presence of
the Venetian fleet in Cretan and Eubœan waters, and to a policy such
as that which conferred upon the historian, Andrea Dandolo, the islet
of Gaidaronisi, to the south of Crete, on condition that he should fortify
its harbour against the assaults of pirates. Naturally, at such a time,
it was the manifest advantage of the Naxiote Dukes to tighten the
alliance with Venice. Accordingly we find Giovanni I preparing to
assist the Venetians in their war with the Genoese, when the latter
suddenly swooped down upon his capital and carried him off as a prisoner
to Genoa.</p>

<p>In 1361, a few years after his release, Giovanni I died, leaving an
only daughter, Fiorenza, as Duchess of the Archipelago. It was the first
time that this romantic State had been governed by a woman, and,
needless to say, there was no lack of competitors for the hand of the rich
and beautiful young widow. During her father’s lifetime Fiorenza had
married one of the Eubœan family of Dalle Carceri, which is often
mentioned in mediæval Greek history, and she had a son by this union,
who afterwards succeeded her in the Duchy. Over her second marriage
there now raged a diplomatic battle, which was waged by Venice with
all the unscrupulousness shown by that astute Republic whenever its
supremacy was at stake. The first of this mediæval Penelope’s suitors
was a Genoese, one of the merchant adventurers, or <i>maonesi</i>, who held
the rich island of Chios much as a modern chartered company holds parts
of Africa under the suzerainty of the home Government. To his candidature
Venice was, of course, strongly opposed, as it would have been
fatal to Venetian interests to have this citizen of Genoa installed at
Naxos. Fiorenza was therefore warned not to bestow her hand upon an
enemy of the Republic, when so many eligible husbands could be found
at Venice or in the Venetian colonies of Eubœa and Crete. At the same
time, the Venetian bailie of Eubœa was instructed to hinder by fair
means or foul the Genoese marriage. Fiorenza meekly expressed her
willingness to marry a person approved by Venice, but soon afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
showed a desire to accept the suit of Nerio Acciajuoli, the subsequent
Duke of Athens. This alliance the Republic vetoed with the same
emphasis as the former one; but Nerio was an influential man, who had
powerful connections in the kingdom of Naples, and was therefore able
to obtain the consent of Robert of Taranto, at that time suzerain of the
Duchy. That Robert was Fiorenza’s suzerain could not be denied; but
Venice replied that she was also a daughter of the Republic, that her
ancestors had won the Duchy under its auspices, had been protected
by its fleets, and owed their existence to its resources. What, it was
added, have the Angevins of Naples done, or what can they do, for
Naxos? Simultaneous orders were sent to the commander of the
Venetian fleet in Greek waters to oppose, by force if necessary, the
landing of Nerio in that island. The Venetian agents in the Levant had,
however, no need of further instructions. They knew what was expected
of them, and were confident that their action, if successful, would not be
disowned. Fiorenza was kidnapped, placed on board a Venetian galley,
and quietly conveyed to Crete. There she was treated with every mark
of respect, but was at the same time plainly informed that if she wished
ever to see her beloved Naxos again she must marry her cousin Nicolò
Sanudo “Spezzabanda,” the candidate of the Republic and son of a
large proprietor in Eubœa. The daring of this young man, to which he
owed his nickname of “Spezzabanda,” “the disperser of a host,” may
have impressed the susceptible Duchess no less than the difficulties of
her position. At any rate she consented to marry him, the wedding was
solemnised at Venice, the Republic pledged itself to protect the Duchy
against all its enemies, and granted to Santorin, which had been reconquered
by Duke Nicolò I, the privilege of exporting cotton and corn to
the Venetian lagoons. Venice had won all along the line, and when the
much-wooed Duchess died, “Spezzabanda” acted as regent for his
stepson, Nicolò II dalle Carceri. He showed his gratitude to his Venetian
patrons by assisting in suppressing the great Cretan insurrection of this
period. He also defended Eubœa against the Catalans of Athens,
showing himself ready to fight for the rights of young Nicolò whenever
occasion offered.</p>

<p>Nicolò II was the last and worst of the Sanudi Dukes. From his
father he had inherited two-thirds of Eubœa, which interested him more
than his own Duchy, but at the same time involved him in disputes with
Venice. Chafing at the tutelage of the Republic, he selected the moment
when Venice was once more engaged in war with Genoa, to negotiate
with the Navarrese company of mercenaries then in Central Greece for
its aid in the conquest of the whole island of Eubœa. This attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
failed, and, so far from increasing his dominions, Nicolò diminished them
in other directions. We have seen how Andros had been reunited with
Naxos by Marco II. The new Duke now bestowed it as a sub-fief upon
his half-sister, Maria Sanudo, thus severing its direct connection with
his Duchy. Nor was he more cautious in his internal policy. He aroused
the strongest resentment among his subjects, Greeks and Franks alike,
by his extortion, and they found a ready leader in a young Italian who
had lately become connected by marriage with the Sanudo family. This
man, Francesco Crispo—a name which suggested to biographers of the
late Italian Prime Minister a possible relationship—was a Lombard who
had emigrated to Eubœa and had then obtained the lordship of Melos
by his union with the daughter of Giovanni I’s brother Marco, who had
received that island as a sub-fief of Naxos, and under whom it had
greatly prospered. Crispo chanced to be in Naxos at the time when the
complaints of the people were loudest, and he aspired to the fame, or
at any rate the profits, of a tyrannicide. During one of the ducal
hunting parties he contrived the murder of the Duke, and was at once
accepted by the populace as his successor. Thus, in 1383, fell the
dynasty of the Sanudi, by the hand of a Lombard adventurer, after 176
years of power.</p>

<p>Times had greatly changed since the conquest of the Archipelago,
nor was a usurper like Crispo in a position to dispense with the protection
of Venice. He therefore begged the Republic to recognise him
as the rightful Duke, which the astute Venetians saw no difficulty in
doing. He further strengthened the bond of union by bestowing the
hand of his daughter upon the rich Venetian, Pietro Zeno, who played
a considerable part in the tortuous diplomacy of the age. Crispo did not
hesitate to rob Maria Sanudo of Andros in order to confer it upon his
son-in-law, and it was not for many years, and then only after wearisome
litigation, that it reverted to her son. She was obliged to content herself
with the islands of Paros and Antiparos, and to marry one of the
Veronese family of Sommaripa, which now appears for the first time in
Greek history, but which came into the possession of Andros towards the
middle of the fifteenth century, and still flourishes at Naxos. Sure of
Venetian support, Crispo indulged in piratical expeditions as far as the
Syrian coast, while he swept other and less distinguished pirates from
the sea. His son-in-law seconded his efforts against the Turks; yet, in
spite of their united attempts, they left their possessions in a deplorable
state. Andros had been so severely visited by the Turkish corsairs that
it contained only 2000 inhabitants, and had to be repopulated by
Albanian immigrants, who are still very numerous there; Ios, almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
denuded of its population, was replenished by a number of families from
the Morea. Although the next Duke, Giacomo I, was known as “The
Pacific,” and paid tribute to the Sultan on condition that no Turkish
ships should visit his islands, he was constantly menaced by Bayezid I.
In his distress, like the Emperor Manuel, he turned to Henry IV of
England, whom he visited in London in 1404. Henry was not able to
assist him, though he had at one time intended to lead an army “as far
as to the sepulchre of Christ”; but, when Henry Beaufort, Bishop of
Winchester, made a pilgrimage to Palestine in 1418, he was conveyed
back to Venice on one of Pietro Zeno’s galleys. This was, so far as we
have been able to discover, the only connection between England and
the Duchy. In the same year Giacomo died at Ferrara, on his way to see
the Pope, the natural protector of the Latins in the Levant.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the fifteenth century the history of the
Archipelago presents a monotonous series of family feuds and Turkish
aggression. The subdivision of the islands, in order to provide appanages
for the younger members of some petty reigning dynasty, was a source
of weakness, which recalls the mediæval annals of Germany, nor did
there arise among the Dukes of this period a strong man like the founder
of the Duchy. One of them was advised by Venice to make the best
terms that he could with the Sultan, though complaints were made that
he had failed to warn the Venetian bailie of Eubœa of the approaching
Turkish fleet, by means of beacon-fires—an incident which takes us back
to the <i>Agamemnon</i> of Æschylus. The fall of Constantinople, followed by
the capture of Lesbos and Eubœa by the Turks, greatly alarmed the
Dukes, who drew closer than ever to the Venetian Republic, and were
usually included in all the Venetian treaties. Other misfortunes greatly
injured the islands. The Genoese plundered Naxos and Andros, and the
volcanic island of Santorin was the scene of a great eruption in 1457,
which threw up a new islet in the port. A few years later, Santorin had
suffered so much from one cause or another that it contained no more
than 300 inhabitants. An earthquake followed this eruption, further
increasing the misery of the Archipelago. But this was the age of
numerous religious foundations, some of them still in existence, such as
the church of Sant’ Antonio at Naxos, which was bestowed upon the
Knights of St John, as their arms on its walls remind the traveller. It
was about this time too that Cyriacus of Ancona, after copying inscriptions
at Athens, visited Andros and other islands of the Ægean.
The island rulers not only received him courteously, but ordered excavations
to be made for his benefit—a proof of culture which should be set
against their wanton destruction of ancient buildings, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
provide materials for their own palaces—a practice of which the tower
at Paros is so striking an example. When we remember that each petty
lord considered it necessary to be well lodged, the extent of these
ravages may be easily imagined.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the fifteenth century the condition of the
islanders had become intolerable, and matters came to a climax under
the rule of Giovanni III. That despotic Duke incurred the displeasure
not only of the Sultan, but also of his own subjects. The former complained
that he had fallen into arrears with his tribute—for the Dukes
had long had to purchase independence by the payment of <i>bakshîsh</i>—and
that he harboured corsairs, who plundered the Asian coast. The
latter grumbled at the heavy taxes which the Duke pocketed without
doing anything for the protection of his people. The Archbishop of Naxos
made himself the mouthpiece of popular discontent, and wrote to
Venice, in the name of the people of Naxos and Paros, offering to acknowledge
the suzerainty of the Republic. Venice replied, authorising
him to point out to the Duke and to Sommaripa, the lord of Paros, the
utter hopelessness of their present position, and to offer them an
assured income for the rest of their lives if they would cede their islands
to a Venetian commissioner. But the negotiations failed; the Naxiotes,
driven to despair, took the law into their own hands, and in 1494
murdered their Duke. The Archbishop then proceeded to Venice, and
persuaded the Senate to take over the Duchy, at least till the late Duke’s
son, Francesco, came of age. During the next six years Venetian Commissioners
administered the islands, which were, however, loyally
handed over to Francesco III at the end of that time. The new Duke
proved unfortunately to be a homicidal maniac, who killed his wife and
tried to kill his heir. As a consequence he was removed to Crete and a
second brief Venetian occupation lasted during the rest of his successor’s
minority<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. The long reign of his son, Giovanni IV, who, soon after his
accession, was captured by Turkish pirates while on a hunting party,
lasted till 1564 and witnessed the loss of many of the Ægean islands.
That great sovereign, Suleyman the Magnificent, now sat upon the
Turkish throne, and his celebrated admiral, Khaireddîn Barbarossa,
spread fire and sword through many a Christian village. In 1537 the
classic island of Ægina, still under Venetian domination, was visited by
this terrible scourge, who massacred all the adult male population, and
took away 6000 women and children as slaves. So complete was the
destruction of the Æginetans that, when a French admiral touched at
the island soon afterwards, he found it devoid of inhabitants. There, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
usual, an Albanian immigration replenished, at least to some extent, the
devastated sites, but Ægina was long in recovering some small measure
of its former prosperity. Thence Barbarossa sailed to Naxos, whence he
carried off an immense booty, compelling the Duke to purchase his
further independence—if such it could be called—by a tribute of 5000
ducats, and submitting him to the ignominy of seeing the furniture of
his own palace sent on board the Admiral’s flagship under his very eyes.
The horrible scenes of those days would seem to have impressed themselves
deeply upon the mind of the wretched Duke, who gave vent to his
feelings in a bitter letter of complaint to the Pope and other Christian
princes. This curious document urged them to “apply their ears and lift
up their eyes, and attend with their minds while their own interests were
still safe,” and reminded them of the evils caused by discord in the
councils of Christendom. The Duke emphasised his admirable truisms,
which might have been addressed to the Concert of Europe at any time
during the last fifty years, by a well-worn tag from Sallust—Sallustius
Crispus, “the author of our race.” But neither his platitudes nor his
allusion to his distinguished ancestry, which he might have had some
difficulty in proving, availed him. The Turks went on in their career of
conquest. Paros was annexed, Andros was forced to pay tribute, the
Venetians lost Skiathos and Skopelos, and by the shameful treaty of
1540 forfeited the prestige which they had so long wielded in the
Levant.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Naxos had long existed by the grace of the Venetian
Republic, and, now that Venice had been crippled, its days were
numbered. The capture of Chios in 1566 was the signal for its dissolution.
As soon as the news arrived in Naxos and Andros that the Turks had
put an end to the rule of the joint-stock company of the Giustiniani in
that fertile island, the Greeks of the Duchy complained to the Sultan of
the exactions to which they were subjected by their Frank lords. There
was some justification for their grievances, for Giacomo IV, the last
of the Frank Dukes, was a notorious debauchee; and the conduct of the
Catholic clergy, by the admission of a Jesuit historian, had become a
public scandal. But the main motive of the petitioners seems to have
been that intense hatred of Catholicism which characterised the
Orthodox Greeks during the whole period of the Frank rule in the
Levant, and which, as we saw under Austrian rule in Bosnia, has not
yet wholly disappeared. Giacomo was fully aware of the delicacy of his
position, and he resolved to convince the Turkish Government, as force
was out of the question, by the only other argument which it understands.
He collected a large sum of money, and went to Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
to reply to his accusers. But he found the ground already undermined
by the artifices of the Œcumenical Patriarch, who had warmly espoused
the cause of the Orthodox Naxiotes, and was in the confidence of the
Turkish authorities. Giacomo had no sooner landed than he was clapped
into prison, where he languished for five months, while the renegade,
Pialì Pasha, quietly occupied Naxos and its dependencies and drove
the Sommaripa out of Andros. But the Greeks of the Duchy soon
discovered that they had made an indifferent bargain. One of the most
important banking houses of the period was that of the Nasi, which had
business in France, the Low Countries, and Italy, and lent money to
kings and princes. The manager of the Antwerp branch was an astute
Portuguese Jew, who at one time called himself João Miquez and posed
as a Christian, and then reverted to Judaism and styled himself Joseph
Nasi. A marriage with a wealthy cousin made him richer than before;
he migrated to the Turkish dominions, where Jews were very popular
with the Sultans, and became a prime favourite of Selim II. This was the
man on whom that sovereign now bestowed the Duchy; and thus, by a
prosaic freak of fortune, the lovely island of classical myth and mediæval
romance became the property of a Jewish banker. Nasi, as a Jew, knew
that he would be loathed by the Greeks, so he never visited his orthodox
Duchy, but appointed a Spaniard named Coronello to act as his agent,
and to screw as much money as possible out of the inhabitants. In this
he was very successful.</p>

<p>As soon as Giacomo IV was released he set out for the west to procure
the aid of the Pope and Venice for the recovery of his dominions, even
pledging himself in that event to do homage to the Republic for them.
But, in spite of the great victory of Lepanto, the Turks remained in
undisturbed possession of the Duchy, except for a brief restoration of
Giacomo’s authority by Venice in 1571. On the accession of Murad III
Giacomo had hopes of obtaining his further restoration through the good
offices of the new Sultan’s mother, a native of Paros, belonging to the
distinguished Venetian family of Baffo. But though she promised her
aid, and he went to plead his cause in person at Constantinople, the
Sultan was inexorable. The last of the Dukes died in the Turkish capital
in 1576, and was buried in the Latin church there. Three years later
Joseph Nasi died also, whereupon the Duchy was placed under the
direct administration of the Porte.</p>

<p>But though Naxos and all the important islands had been annexed
by the Turks, there still remained a few fragments of the Latin rule in
the Levant. The seven islands of Siphnos, Thermia, Kimolos, Polinos,
Pholegandros, Gyaros, and Sikinos were retained by the Gozzadini<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
family on payment of a tribute until 1617, while Venice still preserved
Tenos as a station<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> in the Levant for a whole century more. Everywhere
else in the Ægean the crescent floated from the battlements of the
castles and palaces where for three and a half centuries the Latin nobles
had practised the arts of war.</p>

<p>The occupation of the Greek islands by the Latins was unnatural,
and, like most unnatural things, it was destined not to endure. But this
strange meeting of two deeply interesting races in the classic seats of
Greek lyric poetry can scarcely fail to strike the imagination. And to-day,
when Italy is once more showing a desire to play a <i>rôle</i> in the near
East, when Italians have officered the Cretan police, when Italian troops
have occupied thirteen islands in the lower Ægean since 1912, including
the old Quirini fief of Stampalia, when the Aldobrandini’s thirteenth
century possession of Adalia is being revived, and the statesmen of Rome
are looking wistfully across the Adriatic, it is curious to go back to the
times when Venetian and Lombard families held sway among the islands
of the Ægean, and the Latin galleys, flying the pennons of those petty
princes, glided in and out of the harbours of that classic sea. Even in her
middle age Greece had her romance, and no fitter place could have been
chosen for it than “the wave-beat shore of Naxos.”</p>

<h4 id="heading11">APPENDIX<br />
THE MAD DUKE OF NAXOS</h4>

<p>Subsequent historians of the Duchy of Naxos have accepted without
question Hopf’s<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> chronology and brief description of the reign of
Francesco III Crispo, who was formally proclaimed duke, after a brief
Venetian protectorate, in October 1500. According to the German
scholar, who is followed by Count Mas Latrie<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>, Francesco III “quietly
governed” his island domain down to 1518, the only incident in his
career being his capture by Turkish corsairs while hunting in 1517. His
wife, according to the same authorities, had already predeceased him,
having died “before 1501.” But a perusal of Sanuto’s <i>Diarii</i> shows that
all these statements are wrong. Francesco III, so far from “quietly
governing” his subjects, was a homicidal maniac, who murdered his
wife in 1510 and died in the following year.</p>

<p>We first hear of the duke’s madness in 1509, when he and his brother-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Antonio Loredano, were on board the ducal galley, then engaged
in the Venetian service at Trieste. The duke was put in custody at San
Michele di Murano, but was subsequently released and allowed to return
to Naxos<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. There, as we learn from two separate accounts, one sent to
the Venetian authorities in Crete by the community of Naxos, the other
sent to Venice by Antonio da Pesaro, Venetian governor of Andros, the
duke had a return of the malady<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. On August 15, 1510, he was more
than usually affectionate to his wife, Taddea Loredano, to whom he
had been married fourteen years, and who is described by one of the
Venetian ambassadors as “a lady of wisdom and great talent<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.” Having
inveigled the duchess to his side “by songs, kisses, and caresses,” he
seized his sword and tried to slay her. The terrified woman fled, just as
she was, in her nightdress, out of the ducal palace, and took refuge in
the house of her aunt, Lucrezia Loredano, Lady of Nio. Thither, in the
night of Saturday, August 17, her husband pursued her; he burst open
the doors, and entered the bedroom, where he found the Lady of Nio and
her daughter-in-law, to whom he gave three severe blows each. Meanwhile,
on hearing the noise, the duchess had hidden under a wash-tub;
a slave betrayed her hiding-place, and the duke struck her over the head
with his sword. In the attempt to parry the blow, she seized the blade in
her hands, and fell fainting on the ground, where her miserable assailant
gave her a thrust in the stomach. She lived the rest of the night and the
next day, while the duke fled to his garden, whence he was induced by
the citizens to return to the palace. There, as he sat at meat with his son
Giovanni, he heard from one of the servants that the people wished to
depose him and put Giovanni in his place. In a paroxysm of rage, he
seized a knife to kill his son; but his arm was held, and the lad saved
himself by leaping from the balcony. The duke tried to escape to Rhodes,
but he was seized, after a struggle in which he was wounded, and sent
to Santorin. His son Giovanni IV was proclaimed duke, and as he could
not have been more than eleven years old—his birth is spoken of as
imminent<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> in May 1499—a governor of the duchy was elected in the
person of Jacomo Dezia, whom we may identify with Giacomo I
Gozzadini, baron of the island of Zia, who is mentioned as being present
in the ducal palace at Naxos, in a document<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> of 1500, whose family had
a mansion there, and who had already been governor in 1507. From
Santorin, Francesco III was removed on a Venetian ship to Candia,
where, as we learn from letters of August 15, 1511, he died of fever<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, on October 18, 1510, it had been proposed at Venice
that the mad duke’s brother-in-law, Antonio Loredano, should be sent
as governor to Naxos, with a salary of 400 ducats a year, payable out
of the revenues, just as Venetian governors had been sent there during
the minority of Francesco III. Loredano sailed on January 16, 1511,
for his post, where he remained for four and a half years<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. Naxos, in his
time, cannot have been a gloomy exile, for we hear of the “balls and
festivals with the accompaniment of very polished female society” which
greeted the Venetian ambassador<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. We do not learn who governed the
duchy between July 1515, when Loredano returned to Venice, and the
coming of age of Duke Giovanni IV, which seems to have been in May
1517. On May 6 of that year he wrote a letter to the Cretan government,
signed <i>Joannes Crispus dux Egeo Pelagi</i>, which Sanuto has preserved<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>;
and in the same summer <i>il ducha di Nixia, domino Zuan Crespo</i>, was
captured by corsairs while hunting, and subsequently ransomed<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>—an
adventure which Hopf, as we have seen, wrongly ascribed to Francesco
III.</p>

<h3 id="heading12">7. CRETE UNDER THE VENETIANS (1204-1669)</h3>

<p>Of all the Levantine possessions acquired by Venice as the result
of the Fourth Crusade, by far the most important was the great
island of Crete, which she obtained in August, 1204, from Boniface of
Montferrat to whom it had been given 15 months earlier by Alexios IV,
at the cost of 1000 marks of silver. At that time the population of the
island, which in antiquity is supposed to have been a million, was
probably about 500,000 or 600,000<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. Lying on the way to Egypt and
Syria, it was an excellent stopping-place for the Venetian merchantmen,
and the immense sums of money expended upon its defence prove the
value which the shrewd statesmen of the lagoons set upon it. Whether
its retention was really worth the enormous loss of blood and treasure
which it involved may perhaps be doubted, though in our own days the
Concert of Europe has thought fit to spend about thrice the value of the
island in the process of freeing it from the Turk. What distinguishes the
mediæval history of Crete from that of the other Frank possessions in
the Near East is the almost constant insubordination of the Cretan
population. While in the Duchy of Athens we scarcely hear of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
restlessness on the part of the Greeks, while in the Principality of Achaia
they gave comparatively little trouble, while in the Archipelago they
seldom murmured against their Dukes—in Crete, on the other hand, one
insurrection followed another in rapid succession, and the first 160 years
of Venetian rule are little else than a record of insurrections. The masters
of the island explained this by the convenient theory, applied in our own
time to the Irish, that the Cretans had a double dose of original sin, and
the famous verse of Epimenides, to which the New Testament has given
undying reputation, must have been often in the mouths of Venetian
statesmen. But there were other and more natural reasons for the
stubborn resistance of the islanders. After the reconquest of Crete by
Nikephoros Phokas, the Byzantine Government had sent thither many
members of distinguished military families, and their descendants, the
<i>archontes</i> of the island at the time of the Venetian invasion, furnished
the leaders for these perennial revolts<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. Moreover, the topography of
Crete is admirably suited for guerilla warfare; the combination of an
insular with a highland spirit constitutes a double gage of independence,
and what the Venetians regarded as a vice the modern Greeks reckon as
a virtue.</p>

<p>Even before the Venetians had had time to take possession of the
island, their great rivals, the Genoese, had established a colony there,
so that it was clear from the outset that Venice was not the only Latin
Power desirous of obtaining Crete. The first landing of the Venetians was
effected at Spinalonga, where a small colony was founded. But, before
the rest of the island could be annexed, a Genoese citizen, Enrico
Pescatore, Count of Malta, one of the most daring seamen of his age,
had set foot in Crete in 1206 at the instigation of Genoa, and invited the
Cretans to join his standard. He easily made himself master of the
island, over which he endeavoured to strengthen his hold by the
restoration or construction of fourteen fortresses, still remaining,
although in ruins. A larger force was then despatched from Venice,
which drove out the Maltese adventurer, who appealed to the Pope as
a faithful servant of the Church, and continued to trouble the conquerors
for some years more<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. In 1207 Tiepolo had been appointed the first
Venetian Governor, or Duke, as he was styled, of Crete; but it was not
till the armistice with Genoa in 1212 that the first comprehensive attempt
at colonisation was made, and the organisation of a Cretan Government
was undertaken. According to the feudal principles then in vogue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
which a century earlier had been adopted for the colonisation of the
Holy Land, the island was divided into 132 knights’ fiefs (a number
subsequently raised to 200, and then to 230) and 48 sergeants’ or foot
soldiers’ fiefs, and volunteers were invited to take them. The former
class of lands was bestowed on Venetian nobles, the latter on ordinary
citizens; but in both cases the fiefs became the permanent property of
the holders, who could dispose of them by will or sale, provided that
they bequeathed or sold them to Venetians. The nobles received houses
in Candia, the Venetian capital (which now gave its name to the whole
island), as well as pasture for their cattle, the State reserving to itself
the direct ownership of the strip of coast in which Candia lay, the fort of
Temenos and its precincts, and any gold or silver mines that might
hereafter be discovered. The division of the island into six parts, or
<i>sestieri</i>, was modelled, like the whole scheme of administration, on the
arrangements of the city of Venice, where the <i>sestieri</i> still survive. So
close was the analogy between the colonial and the metropolitan divisions
that the colonists of each <i>sestiere</i> in Crete sprang from the same <i>sestiere</i>
at Venice—a system which stimulated local feeling. At the head of each
<i>sestiere</i> an official known as a <i>capitano</i> was placed, while the government
of the colony was carried on by a greater and a lesser Council of the
colonists, by two Councillors representing the Doge, and by the Duke,
who usually held office for two years. The first batch of colonists was
composed of twenty-six citizens and ninety-four nobles of the Republic,
the latter drawn from some of the best Venetian families. But it is
curious that, while we still find descendants of Venetian houses in the
Cyclades and at Corfù, scarcely a trace of them remains in Crete<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. As
for ecclesiastical matters, always of such paramount importance in the
Levant, the existing system was adopted by the newcomers. Candia
remained an archbishopric, under which the ten bishoprics of the island
were placed; but the churches, with two temporary exceptions, were
occupied by the Latin clergy, and that body was required, no less than
the laity, to contribute its quota of taxation towards the defence of the
capital<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. Although we hear once or twice of a Greek bishop in Crete,
the usual practice was to allow no orthodox ecclesiastic above the rank
of a <i>protopapâs</i> to reside at Candia, while Greek priests had to seek
consecration from the bishops of the nearest Venetian colonies. But, as
the Venetian colonists in course of time became Hellenised and embraced
the Orthodox faith, the original organisation of the Latin church was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
found to be too large, so that, at the time of the Turkish conquest, the
Latin Archbishop of Candia with his four suffragans represented Roman
Catholicism in the island, and outside the four principal towns there was
scarcely a Catholic to be found.</p>

<p>The division of the island into fiefs naturally caused much bad blood
among the natives, who objected to this appropriation of their lands.
In 1212, the same year which witnessed the arrival of the colonists, an
insurrection broke out under the leadership of the powerful family of the
Hagiostephanitai. The rising soon assumed such serious proportions that
Tiepolo called in the aid of Duke Marco I of Naxos, whose duplicity in
this connection was narrated in a previous essay. In addition to these
internal troubles, the Genoese and Alamanno Costa, Count of Syracuse,
an old comrade of the Count of Malta again became active; but the
Venetians wisely purchased the acquiescence of the Genoese in the
existing state of things by valuable concessions, the chief of which was
the recognition of Genoa’s former privileges of trade with the Empire
of Romania, and imprisoned Costa in an iron cage. From that moment,
save for two brief raids in 1266 and 1293, Genoa abandoned the idea of
contesting her rival’s possession of Crete. In the same year, however,
only five years after the first rising, a fresh Cretan insurrection, due to
the high-handed action of the Venetian officials, caused the proud
Republic of St Mark to admit the necessity of conceding something to
the islanders. The ringleaders received a number of knights’ fiefs, and
became Venetian vassals. But a further distribution of lands in the parts
of the island hitherto unconfiscated kindled a new revolt. The rebels,
seeing the growth of the Empire of Nice, offered their country to the
Emperor Vatatzes if he would come and deliver them, while the Duke
summoned the reigning sovereign of Naxos to his aid. The latter withdrew
on the approach of the Nicene admiral, who managed to land a
contingent in the island. Long after the admiral’s departure these men
held their own in the mountains, and it was eight years before the
Venetians succeeded in suppressing the rising. On the death of Vatatzes,
the Cretans seemed to have lost hope of external assistance, and no
further attempt was made to throw off the Venetian yoke till after the
fall of the Latin Empire of Romania. Meanwhile, in 1252, a fresh scheme
of colonisation was carried out; ninety more knights’ fiefs were granted
in the west of the island, and the town of Canea, the present capital, was
founded, on or near the site of the ancient Cydonia<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>; one half of the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
city was reserved to Venice, and the other half became the property of
the colonists.</p>

<p>After the recapture of Constantinople by the Greeks, the value of the
island became greater than ever to the Venetians. Three years after that
event we find the Doge Zeno writing to Pope Urban IV that “the whole
strength of the Empire” lay in Crete, while at the same time the revival
of the Greek cause, both on the Bosporos and in the Morea, led to an
attack upon it by the Byzantine forces. But Venice had less difficulty
in coming to terms with the Emperor than in managing her unruly
subjects. In 1268 the Venetian colonists rose under leaders who bore the
honoured names of Venier and Gradenigo, demanding complete separation
from the mother country. The harsh policy of the Republic towards
her colonies was an excuse for this outbreak; but no further attempt of
the kind was made for another hundred years, when the descendants of
the Venier and the Gradenigo of 1268 headed a far more serious rebellion.
Another Greek rising now followed, this time organised by the brothers
Chortatzai, but the Venetians had now succeeded in winning over a
party among the Cretans, including Alexios Kallerges, the richest of all
the <i>archontes</i>. This man used all his local influence on the side of the
Government; yet even so the rebellion continued for several years, and
at times threatened to gain the upper hand. One Venetian Governor was
lured into the mountains, surprised, and slain; another was driven
behind the walls of Candia, and only saved from capture by the fidelity
of the Greek inhabitants of that district. At last adequate reinforcements
arrived, the Chortatzai were banished from the island, and the
castle of Selino was erected to overawe the rebels in their part of the
country. Peace then reigned for a few years, and the conciliatory policy
of the next Governor earned for him the title of “the good” Duke from
the Cretan subjects of the Republic.</p>

<p>But the calm was soon disturbed by a fresh outbreak. In 1283 the
same Alexios Kallerges who had been so valuable an auxiliary of Venice
in the last rising inaugurated a rebellion which, arising out of the
curtailment of his own family privileges, spread to the whole island and
lasted for sixteen years. The home Government made the mistake of
under-estimating the importance of this movement, which it neglected
to suppress at the outset by the despatch of large bodies of men. As
usual, the insurgents operated in the mountains, whence the Venetians
were unable to dislodge them, while the Genoese laid Canea in ashes in
1293, and tried to establish relations with the insurrectionary chief. But
Kallerges was not disposed to exchange the rule of one Italian State for
that of another, and, as he saw at last that he could not shake off the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
Venetian yoke single-handed, he came to terms with the Governor. His
patriotic refusal of the Genoese offers had excited the admiration of the
Venetians, who were ready to make concessions to one whom Genoa
could not seduce. He was allowed to keep the fiefs which the Angeloi had
granted in the Byzantine days to his family, he was created a knight,
and his heirs received permission to intermarry with Venetians—a
practice absolutely prohibited as a rule in Venetian colonies. It is
pleasant to be able to record that both parties to this treaty kept their
word. Kallerges on his death-bed bade his four sons remain true to
Venice; one of his grandsons fought in her cause, and his descendants
were rewarded with the title of patricians—at that time a rare distinction.
These frequent insurrections, combined with the horrors of
plague and famine, do not seem to have permanently injured the
resources of the island, nor were the ravages of corsairs, fitted out by the
Catalans of Attica in the early part of the fourteenth century, felt much
beyond the coast. At any rate, in 1320 such was the prosperity of the
colony that the Governor was able to remit a large surplus to Venice
after defraying the costs of administration. But the harsh policy of the
Republic gradually alienated the colonists as well as the natives. A
demand for ship-money caused a fresh rebellion of the Greeks in 1333,
in which one of the Kallergai fought for, and another of them against,
the Venetian Government. Eight years later a member of that famous
Cretan family, forgetting the patriotic conduct of his great ancestor,
entered into negotiations with the Turks; but he was invited to a parley
by the Venetian Governor, who had him arrested as a traitor and thrown
in a sack into the sea. This act of cruelty and treachery had the effect
of embittering and prolonging the Cretan resistance, so that the
Venetians soon held nothing in the island except the capital and a few
castles. At last the arrival of overwhelming reinforcements forced the
rebel leader, Michael Psaromelingos, to bid his servant kill him, and the
rebellion was over. The death of this chieftain has formed the subject of
a modern Greek drama, for the Greeks of the mainland have always
admired, and sometimes imitated, the desperate valour of their Cretan
brethren. On the Venetians this revolt made so great an impression that
the Duke was ordered to admit no Cretan into the Great Council of the
island without the special permission of the Doge—an order due as much
to the fears of the home Government as to the jealousy of the colonists.</p>

<p>But the most significant feature of this insurrection was the apathy
of the Venetian vassals in contributing their quota of horses and men
for the defence of the island. Somewhat earlier, the knights had been
compelled, in spite of their vigorous protests, to pay the sum which, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
the terms of their feudal tenure, they were supposed to expend upon
their armed followers, direct to the Exchequer, which took care to see
that the money was properly applied. Many of the poorer among them
now found themselves unable to provide the amounts which the
Government required, and so became heavily indebted to the Treasury.
It was the opinion of Venetian statesmen that Crete should be self-supporting,
but it at last became necessary to grant a little grace to the
impoverished debtors, some of whom had shown signs of coquetting with
the Turks. Thus the discontented Venetian colonists, who had been
born and trained for the most part in an island which exercises a strong
attraction on even foreign residents, found that they had more grievances
in common with the Greeks than bonds of union with the city of their
ancestors. More than a century and a half had elapsed since the first
great batch of colonists had left the lagoons for the great Greek island.
Redress had been stubbornly refused, and it only needed a spark to set
the whole colony ablaze.</p>

<p>In 1362 a new Duke, Leonardo Dandolo, arrived at Candia with
orders from the Venetian Senate to demand from the knights a contribution
towards the repair of the harbour there. The knights contended
that, as the harbour would benefit trade, which was the interest of the
Republic, while their income was exclusively derived from agriculture,
the expense should be borne by the home Government. As the Senate
persisted, the whole body of knights rose under the command of two
young members of the order, Tito Venier, Lord of Cerigo—the island
which afterwards formed part of the Septinsular Republic—and Tito
Gradenigo, entered the Duke’s palace, and put him and his Councillors
in irons. Having arrested all the Venetian merchants whom they could
find, the rebels then proclaimed the independence of Crete—how often
since then has it not been announced!—appointed Marco Gradenigo,
Tito’s uncle, Duke, and elected four Councillors from their own ranks.
In order to obtain the support of the Greeks they declared that the
Roman Catholic ritual had ceased to exist throughout the island, and
announced their own acceptance of the Orthodox faith. In token of the
new order of things the Venetian insignia were torn down from all the
public buildings, and St Mark made way for Titus, the patron saint and
first bishop of Crete<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. The theological argument was more than the Greeks
could resist, and the descendants of Catholic Venetians and Orthodox
<i>archontes</i> made common cause against Popery and the tax-collector.</p>

<p>When the news reached Venice, it excited the utmost consternation.
But, as no sufficient forces were available, the Republic resolved to try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
what persuasion could effect. A trusty Greek from the Venetian colony
of Modon was sent to treat with the Greeks, while five commissioners
proceeded to negotiate with the revolutionary Government at Candia.
The commissioners were courteously heard; but when it was found that
they were empowered to offer nothing but an amnesty, and that only on
condition of prompt submission to the Republic, they were plainly told
that the liberty recently won by arms should never be sacrificed to the
commands of the Venetian Senate. Nothing remained but to draw the
sword, and the home Government had prudently availed itself of the
negotiations to begin its preparations, both diplomatic and naval. All
the Powers friendly to Venice, the Pope, the Emperor Charles IV, the
King of France, and the Queen of Naples, even Genoa herself, forbade
their subjects to trade with the island, and the Pope, alarmed at the
apostasy of the colonists, addressed a pastoral to the recalcitrant
Cretans. But neither papal arguments nor an international boycott
could bend the stubborn minds of the insurgents. It was not till the
arrival of the Venetian fleet and army, the latter under the command of
Luchino dal Verme, the friend of Petrarch, who had warned him, with
the inevitable allusions to the classic poets and to St Paul, of the
“untruthfulness,” “craft,” and “deceit” of the Cretans, that the
movement was crushed.</p>

<p>The armament was of considerable size. Italy had been ransacked
for soldiers, the Duchy of the Archipelago and Eubœa for ships, and
Nicolò “Spezzabanda,” the regent of Naxos, hastened to assist his
Venetian patrons. Candia speedily fell, and then the commissioners who
accompanied the military and naval forces proceeded to mete out
punishment to the chief insurgents without mercy. Marco Gradenigo
and two others were beheaded on the platform of the castle, where
their corpses were ordered to remain, under penalty of the loss of a hand
to any one who tried to remove them. The same bloody and brief
assizes were held in Canea and Rethymno; the most guilty were
executed, the less conspicuous were banished. Tito Venier was captured
by Venetian ships on the high sea, and paid for his treasonable acts with
his head; his accomplice, Tito Gradenigo, managed to escape to Rhodes,
but died in exile. The property of the conspirators was confiscated by
the State.</p>

<p>Great was the joy at Venice when it was known that the insurrection
had been suppressed. Three days were given up to thanksgivings and
festivities, at which Petrarch was present, and of which he has left an
account. Foreign powers congratulated the Republic on its success,
while in Crete itself the new Duke ordered the celebration of May 10<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
in each year-the anniversary of the capitulation of Candia—as a public
holiday. But the peace, or perhaps we should say desolation, of the
island was soon disturbed. Some of the banished colonists combined
with three brothers of the redoubtable family of the Kallergai, who
proclaimed the Byzantine Emperor sovereign of Crete. This time the
Venetian Government sent troops at once to Candia, but hunger proved
a more effective weapon than the sword. The inhabitants of Lasithi,
where the insurgents had their headquarters, surrendered the ringleaders
rather than starve. Then followed a fresh series of savage
sentences, for the Republic considered that no mercy should be shown
to such constant rebels. While the chiefs were sent to the block, the
whole plateau of Lasithi was converted into a desert, the peasants were
carried off and their cottages pulled down, and the loss of a foot and the
confiscation of his cattle were pronounced to be the penalty of any
farmer or herdsman who should dare to sow corn there or to use the spot
for pasture. This cruel and ridiculous order was obeyed to the letter;
for nearly a century one of the most fertile districts of Crete was allowed
to remain in a state of nature, till at last in 1463 the urgent requirements
of the Venetian fleet compelled the Senate to consent to the recultivation
of Lasithi. But as soon as the temporary exigencies of the public
service had been satisfied, Lasithi fell once more under the ban, until
towards the end of the fifteenth century the plain was placed under the
immediate supervision of the Duke and his Councillors. It would be
hard to discover any more suicidal policy than this, which crippled the
resources of the colony in order to gratify a feeling of revenge. But it has
ever been the misfortune of Crete that the folly of her rulers has done
everything possible to counteract her natural advantages.</p>

<p>A long period of peace now ensued, a peace born not of prosperous
contentment but of hopeless exhaustion. The first act of the Republic
was to substitute for the original oath of fealty, exacted from the
colonists at the time of the first great settlement in 1212, a much stricter
formula of obedience. The next was to put up to auction the vacant fiefs
of the executed and banished knights at Venice, for it had been resolved
that none of those estates should be acquired by members of the Greek
aristocracy. The bidding was not very brisk, for Crete had a bad character
on the Venetian exchange, so that, some years later, on the destruction
of the castle of Tenedos, the Republic transported the whole population
to Candia. There they settled outside the capital in a suburb which, from
their old home, received the name of Le Tenedee<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.</p>

<p>We hear little about Crete during the first half of the fifteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
century, which was so critical a time for the Franks of the mainland.
The principal grievance of the colonists at that period seems to have
been the arrogance of the Jews, against whom they twice petitioned
the Government. It was a Jew, however, who, together with a priest,
betrayed to the Duke the plot which had been concocted by a leading
Greek of Rethymno in 1453 for the murder of all the Venetian officials
on one day, the incarceration of all other foreigners, and the proclamation
of a Greek prince as sovereign of the island. The capture of
Constantinople by the Turks in that year, followed as it was by the flight
of many Greek families to Crete, induced the Venetians to take more
stringent precautions against the intrigues of their Cretan subjects. An
order was issued empowering the Duke to make away with any suspected
Cretans without trial or public inquiry of any kind. We are reminded by
this horrible ordinance of the secret commission for the slaughter of
dangerous Helots which had been one of the laws of Lycurgus. Nothing
could better show the insecurity of Venetian rule, even after two
centuries and a half had passed since the conquest. Another incident,
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, shows how savage was the
punishment meted out to the insurgents, with the approval of the
authorities. At that period the Cretans of Selmo, Sphakia, and the
Rhiza, not far from the latter place united their forces against their
Venetian masters under the leadership of the Pateropouloi clan. The
three insurgent districts were formed into an independent Republic, of
which a leading Greek was chosen Rector. The Venetians of Canea,
under the pretext of a wedding feast at the villa of one of their countrymen
at the charming village of Alikianou, lured the Rector and some
fifty of his friends to that place, seized the guests after the banquet, and
hanged or shot him, his son, and many others in cold blood. The
remainder of the rebels were rigorously proscribed, and a pardon was
granted to those alone who produced at Canea the gory head of a father,
a brother, a cousin, or a nephew<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. Nor were the foes of Venice only those
of her own household. The Turkish peril, which had manifested itself in
sporadic raids before the fall of Constantinople, became more pressing
after the loss of the Morea. Appeals were made by the inhabitants for
reinforcements and arms, and at last, when the capture of Eubœa by the
Turks had deprived them of that valuable station, the Venetians turned
their thoughts to the protection of Crete, and resolved to restore the
walls of Candia. Those who saw, like the author, those magnificent
fortifications before the sea-gate was destroyed by the British troops in
1898, can estimate the strength of the town in the later Venetian period.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Unfortunately, those ramparts, which afterwards kept the Turks at bay
for twenty-four years, could not prevent the dreaded Barbarossa’s
ravages on other parts of the coast. In 1538 that great captain appeared
with the whole Turkish fleet—then a very different affair from the
wretched hulks of 1898 which were a terror only to their crews—landed
at Suda Bay, laid all the adjacent country waste, and nearly captured
Canea. Thirty years later, this raid was repeated with even greater
success, for Rethymno was destroyed, and soon the loss of Cyprus
deprived Crete of a bulwark which had hitherto divided the attention
of the advancing Turk. Venice was, at length, thoroughly alarmed for
the safety of her great possession, and she took the resolve of introducing
drastic reforms into the island. With this object an experienced statesman,
Giacomo Foscarini, was sent to Crete in 1574 as special
commissioner, with full powers to inquire into, and redress, the grievances
of the islanders. Foscarini, well aware that his task would be no easy
one, endeavoured to excuse himself on private grounds; but his
patriotism prevailed over all other considerations, and he set out for
Crete with the intention of increasing the resources of the island and at
the same time protecting the inhabitants against the oppression of those
placed over them. In accordance with this policy, he issued, as soon as
he had landed, a proclamation, urging all who had grievances against
any Venetian official to come without fear, either openly or in secret,
before him, in the certainty of obtaining justice and redress. He then
proceeded to study the condition of the country, and it is fortunate that
the results of his investigation have been preserved in an official report,
which throws a flood of light on the state of Crete during the latter half
of the sixteenth century<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of Foscarini’s visit the island was divided up into 479
fiefs, 394 of which belonged to Venetians, who were no longer subdivided
into the two original classes of knights and sergeants, or foot
soldiers, but were all collectively known as knights. Of the remaining fiefs,
thirty-five belonged to native Cretan families, twenty-five to the Latin
Church, and twenty-five to the Venetian Government. None of these
last three classes paid taxes or yielded service of any sort to the Republic,
though a rent was derived from such of the State domains as were let.
As might be guessed from the frequent repetition of Cretan insurrections,
the condition of the native Cretan aristocracy was one of the most serious
problems in the island. When Venice had adopted, somewhat reluctantly,
the plan of bestowing fiefs on the Greek leaders, twelve prominent
Cretan families had been selected, whose descendants, styled <i>archontópouloi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
or <i>archontoromaîoi</i>, formed a privileged class without obligations
of any sort. As time went on, the numbers of these families had
increased, till, shortly before Foscarini’s visit, they comprised at least
400 souls. But, as the number of the fiefs at their disposal remained the
same, a series of subdivisions became necessary, and this led to those
continual quarrels, which were the inevitable result of the feudal system
all over Greece. A hard and fast line was soon drawn between the
richer “sons of the <i>archontes</i>,” who lived a life of idleness and luxury in
the towns, and the poorer members of the clan, who sank into the position
of peasants on their bit of land, without, however, losing their privileges
and their pride of descent. The latter quality involved them in perpetual
feuds with rival families equally aristocratic and equally penniless, and
the celebrated district of Sphakia, in particular, had even then acquired
the evil notoriety for turbulent independence which it preserved down
to the end of the nineteenth century. Shortly before Foscarini appeared
on the scene, a Venetian commissioner had paid a visit to that spot for
the express purpose of chastising the local family of the Pateroi, whose
hereditary feud with the family of the Papadopouloi of Rethymno had
become a public scandal. Both the parties, the latter of whom still has
a representative in an illustrious family resident at Venice, were of
common stock, for both were branches of the ancient Cretan clan of the
Skordiloi. But they hated one another with all the bitterness of near
relatives; revenge was the most precious heritage of their race; the
bloody garment of each victim was treasured up by his family, every
member of which wore mourning till his murder had been wiped out in
blood; and thus, as in Albania to-day, and in Corsica in the days of
Mérimée, there was no end to the chain of assassinations. On this
occasion the Sphakiotes, who could well maintain the classic reputation
of the Cretan bowmen, were completely crushed by the heavily armed
troops of Venice. Their homes were burned to the ground, those who
resisted were slain; those who were captured were sent into exile at
Corfù, where they mostly died of cruel treatment or home-sickness, the
home-sickness which every true Cretan feels for his mountains. The
survivors of the clan were forbidden to rebuild their dwellings or to
approach within many miles of their beloved Sphakia. The inhospitable
valleys and rough uplands became their refuge, and winter and lack of
food had been steadily diminishing their numbers when Foscarini
arrived at Sphakia to see for himself how things were in that notorious
district.</p>

<p>Sphakia lies on the south coast of the island, almost exactly opposite
the Bay of Suda on the north. Foscarini describes it as consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
“a very weak tower,” occupied by a Venetian garrison of eleven men,
and a small hamlet built in terraces on the hills. The wildness of the
scenery was in keeping, he says, with the wildness of the inhabitants,
whose bravery, splendid physique, and agility in climbing the rocks he
warmly praises. Their appearance suggested to him a comparison with
“the wild Irish,” and they have certainly vied with the latter in the
trouble which they have given to successive Governments. Their long
hair and beards, their huge boots and vast skirts, the dagger, sword, bow
and arrows, which every Sphakiote constantly carried, and the unpleasant
odour of goats, which was derived from their habit of sleeping in caves
among their herds, and which clung to their persons, struck the observant
Venetian in a more or less agreeable manner. Yet he remarked that, if
they were let alone and not agitated by family feuds, they were a mild
and gentle race, and the peasant spokesman of the clan seemed to him
one of nature’s noblemen. With this man Foscarini came to terms,
promising the Pateroi a free pardon, their return to their homes, and the
restoration of their villages, on condition that they should furnish men
for the Venetian galleys, send a deputation twice a year to Canea, and
work once annually on the fortifications of that town. The Sphakiotes
loyally kept these conditions during the stay of Foscarini in the island,
their district became a model of law and order, while their rivals, the
Papadopouloi, were frightened into obedience by the threats of the
energetic commissioner. He further organised all the native clans in
companies for service in the militia under chiefs, or <i>capitani</i>, chosen by
him from out of their midst and paid by the local government. This local
militia was entrusted with the policing of the island, on the sound
principle that a former brigand makes the best policeman. Disobedience
or negligence was punished by degradation from the privileged class of
free <i>archontópouloi</i>, and thus the military qualities of the Cretans were
diverted into a useful channel, and a strong motive provided for their
loyalty. Similarly since the union with Greece the Cretans have become
excellent constables.</p>

<p>The next problem was that of the Venetian knights. It had been the
original intention of the Republic that none of their fiefs should pass
into Greek hands. But as time went on many of the colonists had
secretly sold their estates to the natives, and had gone back to Venice
to spend the proceeds of the sale in luxurious idleness. When Foscarini
arrived, he found that many even of those Venetians who remained in
Crete had become Greek in dress, manners, and speech. More than sixty
years earlier we hear complaints of the lack of Catholic priests and of the
consequent indifference of the colonists to the religion of their forefathers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
so that we are not surprised to hear Foscarini deploring the
numerous conversions of the Venetians in the country districts to the
Orthodox faith through the want of Latin churches. In the town of
Candia, where the nobles were better off, they still remained strict
Catholics, and this difference of religion marked them off from the
Orthodox people; but their wives had adopted Oriental habits, and lived
in the seclusion which we associate with the daily life of women in the
East. In Canea, which was a more progressive place than the capital,
things were a little more hopeful, but even there education was almost
entirely neglected. In the country, owing to the subdivision of fiefs,
many of the smaller Venetian proprietors had sunk to the condition of
peasants, retaining neither the language nor the chivalrous habits of
their ancestors, but only the sonorous names of the great Venetian
houses whence they sprang. All the old martial exercises, on which the
Republic had relied for the defence of the island, had long fallen into
abeyance. Few of the knights could afford to keep horses; few could ride
them. When they were summoned on parade at Candia, they were wont
to stick some of their labourers on horseback, clad in their own armour,
to the scandal of the Government and the amusement of the spectators,
who would pelt these improvised horsemen with bad oranges or stones.
Another abuse arose from the possession of one estate by several
persons, who each contributed a part of the horse’s equipment which the
estate was expected to furnish. Thus the net result of the feudal
arrangements in Crete at this period was an impoverished nobility and
an utterly inadequate system of defence.</p>

<p>Foscarini set to work to remedy these evils with great courage. He
proceeded to restore the old feudal military service, with such alterations
as the times required. He announced that neglect of this public
duty would be punished by confiscation of the vassal’s fief; he abolished
the combination of several persons for the equipment of one horse, but
ordered that the small proprietors should each provide one of the cheap
but hardy little Cretan steeds, leaving the wealthier knights to furnish
costlier animals. By this means he created a chivalrous spirit among the
younger nobles, who began to take pride in their horses, and 1200
horsemen were at the disposal of the State before he left the island. He
next turned his attention to the remedy of another abuse—the excessive
growth of the native Cretan aristocracy owing to the issue of patents of
nobility by corrupt officials. Still worse was the reckless bestowal of
privileges, such as exemptions from personal service on the galleys and
from labour on the fortifications, upon Cretans of humble origin, or even
upon whole communities. The latter practice was specially objectionable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
because the privileged communities exercised a magnetic attraction
upon the peasants of other districts, who flocked into them, leaving the
less favoured parts of the island almost depopulated. Quite apart from
this cause, the diminution of the population, which at the time of the
Venetian conquest was about half a million, but had sunk to 271,489
shortly before Foscarini’s arrival, was sufficiently serious. It is obvious
that in ancient times, Crete with its “ninety cities” must have supported
a large number of inhabitants; but the plagues, famines, and earthquakes
of the sixteenth century had lessened the population, already
diminished by Turkish raids and internal insurrections. In 1524 no
fewer than 24,000 persons died of the plague, and the Jews alone were an
increasing body. Against them Foscarini was particularly severe; he
regarded the fair Jewesses of Candia as the chief cause of the moral
laxity of the young nobles; he absolutely forbade Christians to accept
service in Jewish families; and nowhere was his departure so welcome
as in the Ghetto of Candia. The peasants, on the other hand, regarded
him as a benefactor; for their lot, whether they were mere serfs or
whether they tilled the land on condition of paying a certain proportion
of the produce, was by no means enviable. The serfs, or <i>pároikoi</i>, were
mostly the descendants of the Arabs who had been enslaved by Nikephoros
Phokas, and who could be sold at the will of their masters. The
free peasants were overburdened with compulsory work by the Government,
as well as by the demands of their lords. In neither case was
Foscarini sure that he had been able to confer any permanent benefit
upon them. At least, he had followed the maxim of an experienced
Venetian, that the Cretans were not to be managed by threats and
punishments.</p>

<p>He concluded his mission by strengthening the two harbours of Suda
and Spinalonga, by increasing the numbers and pay of the garrison, by
improving the Cretan fleet and the mercantile marine, and by restoring
equilibrium to the budget. The Levantine possessions of Venice cost her
at this period more than they brought in, and it was the desire of the
Republic that Crete, should, at any rate, be made to pay expenses. With
this object, Foscarini regulated the currency, raised the tariff in such a
way that the increased duties fell on the foreign consumer, saw that they
were honestly collected, and endeavoured to make the island more
productive. But in all his reforms the commissioner met with stubborn
resistance from the vested interests of the Venetian officials and the
fanaticism of the Orthodox clergy, always the bitterest foes of Venice
in the Levant. In dealing with the latter, Foscarini saw that strong
measures were necessary; he persuaded his Government to banish the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
worst agitators, and to allow the others to remain only on condition that
they behaved well. Then, after more than four years of labour, he
returned to Venice, where he was thanked by the Doge for his eminent
services. He had been, indeed, as his monument in the Carmelite church
there says, “Dictator of the island of Candia”; but even his heroic policy
did “but skin and film the ulcerous place.” Not ten years after his
departure we find another Venetian authority, Giulio de Garzoni, writing
of the tyranny of the knights and officials, the misery of the natives, the
disorder of the administration, and the continued agitation of the Greek
clergy among the peasantry. So desperate had the latter become that
there were many who preferred even the yoke of the Sultan to that of
the Catholic Republic<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>. The population of the island, which Foscarini
had estimated at 219,000, had sunk in this short space of time to about
176,000. Numbers of Cretans had emigrated to Constantinople since
Foscarini left, where they formed a large portion of the men employed
in the Turkish arsenal, and where the information which they gave to
the Turks about the weakness of the Cretan garrison and forts filled the
Venetian representatives with alarm. Yet Venice seemed powerless to
do more for the oppressed islanders; indeed, she inclined rather to the
Machiavellian policy of Fra Paolo Sarpi, who advised her to treat the
Cretans like wild beasts, upon whom humanity would be only thrown
away, and to govern the island by maintaining constant enmity between
the barbarised colonists and the native barbarians. “Bread and the
stick, that is all that you ought to give them.” Such a policy could only
prevail so long as Venice was strong enough to defend the colony, or
wise enough to keep at peace with the Sultan.</p>

<p>The latter policy prevailed for nearly three-quarters of a century
after the peace between Venice and the Porte in 1573, and during that
period we hear little of Crete. The quaint traveller Lithgow<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>, who
visited it in the first decade of the seventeenth century, alludes to a
descent of the Turks upon Rethymno in 1597, when that town was again
sacked and burned; and he remarks, as Plato had done in <i>The Laws</i>, that
he never saw a Cretan come out of his house unarmed. He found a
Venetian garrison of 12,000 men in the island, and reiterates the
preference of the Cretans for Turkish rule, on the ground that they would
have “more liberty and less taxes.” But while he was disappointed to
find no more than four cities in an island which in Homer’s day had
contained ninety, he tells us that Canea had “ninety-seven palaces,”
and he waxes eloquent over the great fertility of the country near Suda.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
It is curious to find, nearly three centuries ago, that Suda bay was
eagerly coveted by a foreign potentate, the King of Spain, of whose
designs the astute Venetians were fully aware, and whose overtures they
steadily declined.</p>

<p>The time had now arrived when the Cretans were to realise their
desires, and exchange the Venetian for the Turkish rule. The Ottoman
sultans had long meditated the conquest of the island, and two recent
events had infuriated Ibrahim I against the Venetians. The Near East
was at that time cursed with a severe outbreak of piracy, in which there
was little to choose between Christians and Mussulmans. While the
Venetians had chased some Barbary corsairs into the Turkish harbour of
Valona, on the coast of Albania, and had injured a minaret with their
shots, they had allowed a Maltese squadron, which had captured the
nurse of the Sultan’s son, to sail into a Cretan harbour with its booty.
The fury of the Sultan, whose affection for his son’s nurse was well
known, was not appeased by the apologies of the Venetian representative.
Great preparations were made for an expedition against Crete, and
Ibrahim constantly went down to the arsenals to urge on the workmen.
All over the Turkish empire the word went forth to make ready. The
forests of the Morea were felled to furnish palisades, the naval stores
of Chalkis were emptied to supply provisions for the troops. All the time
the Grand Vizier kept assuring the Venetian bailie that these gigantic
efforts were directed not against the Republic, but against the knights
of Malta. In vain the Mufti protested against this act of deception, and
pleaded that, if war there must be against Venice, at least it might be
open. The Capitan-Pasha and the war party silenced any religious
scruples of the Sultan, and the Mufti was told to mind his own business.
As soon as the truth dawned upon the Venetians they lost no time in
preparing to meet the Turks. Andrea Cornaro, the new Governor of
Crete, hastily strengthened the fortifications of Candia and of the island
at the mouth of Suda bay, while the home Government sent messages
for aid to every friendly State, from Spain to Persia, with but little
result. The Great Powers were then at each other’s throats; France was
quarrelling with Spain, Germany was still in the throes of the Thirty
Years’ War, England was engaged in the struggle between King and
Parliament, and it was thought that the English wine trade would
benefit by the Turkish conquest of Crete. Besides, the downfall of the
Levantine commerce of Venice was regarded with equanimity by our
Turkey merchants, and the Venetians accused us of selling munitions of
war to the infidel. It was remarked, too, that Venice, of all States, was
the least entitled to expect Christendom to arm in her defence, for no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
other Government had been so ready to sacrifice Christian interests in
the Levant when it suited her purpose. Only the Pope and a few minor
States promised assistance.</p>

<p>In 1645 the Turkish fleet sailed with sealed orders for the famous bay
of Navarino. Then the command was given to arrest all Venetian subjects,
including the Republic’s representative at Constantinople, and the
Turkish commander, a Dalmatian renegade, set sail for Crete. Landing
without opposition to the west of Canea, he proceeded to besiege that
town, whose small but heroic garrison held out for two months before
capitulating. The principal churches were at once converted into mosques;
but the losses of the Turks during the siege, and the liberal terms which
their commander had felt bound to offer to the besieged, cost him his
head. At Venice great was the consternation at the loss of Canea;
enormous pecuniary sacrifices were demanded of the citizens, and titles
of nobility were sold in order to raise funds for carrying on the war.
Meanwhile, an attempt to create a diversion by an attack upon Patras
only served to exasperate the Turks, who became masters of Rethymno
in 1646, and in the spring of 1648 began that memorable siege of Candia
which was destined to last for more than twenty years. Even though
Venice sued for peace, and offered to the Sultan Parga and Tenos<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, as
well as a tribute, in return for the restoration of Canea and Rethymno,
the Turks remained obdurate, and were resolved at all costs to have the
island, “even though the war should go on for a hundred years.” And
indeed it seemed likely to be prolonged indefinitely. The substitution of
Mohammed IV for Ibrahim I as Sultan, and the consequent confusion
at the Turkish capital, made it difficult for the Turks to carry on the
struggle with the vigour which they had shown at the outset. The
Venetian fleet waited at the entrance of the Dardanelles to attack
Turkish convoys on their way to Crete, while the Ottoman provision-stores
at Volo and Megara were burned. But these successes outside of
the island delayed, without preventing, the progress of the Turkish arms.
In fact, the Venetian forays in the Archipelago, notably at Paros and
Melos, had the effect of embittering the Greeks against them, and, as a
Cretan poet wrote, the islanders had to suffer, whichever side they took.
In Crete itself, an ambitious Greek priest persuaded the Porte to have
him appointed Metropolitan of the island, and to allow him to name
seven suffragans. The Cretan militia refused to fight, and even the
warlike Sphakiotes, under the leadership of a Kallerges, did little beyond
cutting off a few Turkish stragglers. At last they yielded to the Turks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
whose humane treatment of the Greek peasants throughout the island,
combined with the unpopularity of the Latin rule, frustrated the attempt
to provoke a general rising of the Cretans against the invaders. Nor was
a small French force, which Cardinal Mazarin at last sent to aid the
Venetians, more successful. Both sides were, in fact, equally hampered
and equally unable to obtain a decisive victory; the Venetian fleet at
the islet of Standia, and the Turkish army in the fortress of New Candia,
which it had erected, kept watching one another, while year after year
the wearisome war dragged on. Then, in 1666, a new element was
introduced into the conflict. The Grand Vizier, Ahmed Köprili, landed
in Crete, resolved to risk his head upon the success of his attempt to take
Candia<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</p>

<p>For two years and a half Köprili patiently besieged the town, with
an immense expenditure of ammunition and a great loss of life. Worse
and worse grew the condition of the garrison, which was commanded by
the brave Francesco Morosini, who was destined later on to inflict such
tremendous blows upon the Turks in the Morea. A ray of hope illumined
the doomed fortress when, in June 1669, a force of 8000 French soldiers
under the Duc de Navailles, and fifty French vessels under the Duc de
Beaufort, arrived in the harbour, sent by Louis XIV, at the urgent
prayer of Pope Clement IX, to save this bulwark of Catholicism. But
these French auxiliaries met with no success. Four days after their
arrival, the Duc de Beaufort fell in a sally outside the walls<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. His
colleague, the Duc de Navailles, soon lost heart, and sailed away to
France, leaving the garrison to its fate. His departure was the turning-point
in the siege. The houses were riddled with shots, the churches were
in ruins, the streets were strewn with splinters of bombs and bullets,
every day diminished the number of the defenders, and sickness was
raging in the town. Then Morosini saw that it was useless to go on
fighting. He summoned a council of war, and proposed that the garrison
should capitulate. A few desperate men opposed his proposition, saying
that they would rather blow up the place and die, as they had fought,
like heroes among its ruins. But Morosini’s opinion prevailed, the white
flag was hoisted on the ramparts, and two plenipotentiaries—one of
them an Englishman, Colonel Thomas Anand—were appointed to settle
the terms of capitulation with the Grand Vizier, who was represented at
the conference by a Greek, Panagiotes Nikouses, the first of his race who
became Grand Dragoman of the Porte<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. Köprili insisted upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
complete cession of Crete, with the exception of the three fortresses of
Suda, Spinalonga, and Grabusa, with the small islands near them; but
he showed his appreciation of the heroic defence of Candia by allowing
the garrison to march out with all the honours of war. On September 27
the keys of the town were handed to him on a silver dish, and on the
same day, the whole population, except six persons, left the place.
There, at least, the Greeks preferred exile to Turkish rule, and one of
Köprili’s first acts was to induce fresh inhabitants to come to the
deserted town by the promise of exemption from taxes for several years.</p>

<p>The cost of this siege, one of the longest in history, “Troy’s rival,”
as Byron called it<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>, had been enormous. The Venetians, it was calculated,
had lost 30,985 men, and the Turks 118,754, and the Republic had spent
4,253,000 ducats upon the defence of this one city. Some idea of the
miseries inflicted by this long war of a quarter of a century may be
formed from the fact that the population of Crete, which had risen to
about 260,000 before it began, was estimated by the English traveller
Randolph, eighteen years after the Turkish conquest, at only 80,000, of
whom 30,000 were Turks. Even before the siege it had been said that
Crete cost far more than it was worth, and from the pecuniary standpoint
the loss of the island was a blessing in disguise. But a cession of
territory cannot be measured by means of a balance-sheet. The prestige
of the Republic had been shattered, her greatest possession in the
Levant had been torn from her, and once more the disunion of the
Western Powers had been the Turk’s opportunity. Both the parties to
the treaty were accused of having concluded an unworthy peace. Every
successful Turkish commander has enemies at home, who seek to
undermine his influence; but Köprili was strong enough to keep his
place. Morosini, less fortunate, was, indeed, acquitted of the charges
of bribery and malversation brought against him, but he was not
employed again for many years, until he was called upon to take a noble
revenge for the loss of Candia.</p>

<p>Venice did not retain her three remaining Cretan fortresses indefinitely.
Grabusa was betrayed by its venal commander to the Turks in 1691; Suda
and Spinalonga were captured in 1715 during the Turco-Venetian War,
and the Treaty of Passarovitz confirmed their annexation to Turkey<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<p>So, after 465 years, the Venetian domination came to an end. From
the Roman times to the present day no government has lasted so long
in that restless island; and the winged lion on many a building, the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
galley arches on the left of the port of Candia, and the chain of Venetian
fortresses, of which Prof. Gerola has given a detailed description in his
great work, <i>Venetian Monuments in the island of Crete</i>, remind us of
the bygone rule of the great republic. But the traveller will inquire in
vain for the descendants of those Venetian colonists whose names have
been preserved in the archives at Venice. Rather than remain in Crete,
most of them emigrated to Corfù or to the Ægean islands, or else
returned to Venice—reluctantly, we may be sure, for Crete has ever
exercised a strange fascination on all who have dwelt there. Now that
Crete is once more emancipated from the Turk, it is possible to compare
the Venetian and the Ottoman rule, and even Greeks themselves, no
lovers of the Latins in the Levant, have done justice to the merits of
the Republic of St Mark. The yoke of Venice was at times heavy,
and her hand was relentless in crushing out rebellion. But a Greek
writer of eminence has admitted that the Venetian administration in
Crete was not exceptionally cruel, if judged by the low standard of
humanity in that period<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. Some persons, on the strength of certain
striking instances of ferocious punishment inflicted on those who had
taken part in the Cretan risings<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>, have pronounced the Venetians to
have been worse than the Turks. But in our own day the Germans,
who boast of their superior education, have exterminated the inhabitants
of a South Sea island as vengeance for the murder of one missionary
and have incited the Turks to massacre the Armenians. It should be
reckoned to the credit of Venice that she, at least, did not attack the
religion, or attempt to proscribe the language, of her Greek subjects, but
sternly repelled the proselytising zeal of the Papacy, so that the Orthodox
Church gained more followers than it lost. The permission accorded in
Crete to mixed marriages tended to make the children of the Venetian
colonists good Cretans and luke-warm Catholics, where they did not go
over to the Orthodox creed. The Greeks were given a share in the
administration, trade was encouraged, and many of the natives amassed
large fortunes. At no time in the history of the island was the export of
wine so considerable as during the Venetian occupation. So great was
the wine trade between Crete and England that Henry VIII appointed
in 1522 a certain merchant of Lucca, resident in the island, as first
English Consul there—the beginning of our consular service. Various
travellers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries allude to this
traffic, and Ben Jonson, in his play of <i>The Fox</i>, talks of “rich Candian
wine” as a special vintage. In return, we sent woollens to the islanders,
till the French managed to supplant us<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. Nor was learning neglected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
under the Venetians. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries produced
many Cretans of distinction, among them Pope Alexander V. One
became a famous engineer, two others gained renown as printers at
Venice and Rome; a great Cretan artist, Domenicos Theotokopoulos,
obtained undying fame at Madrid under the name of “El Greco”; one
Cretan author edited the Moral Treatises of Plutarch; another, Joannes
Bergikios, wrote a history of his native island in Italian. We have two
poems in Greek by the Cretans Bouniales and Skleros upon the war of
Candia<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. It was a Cretan of Venetian origin, Vincenzo Comaro, who
wrote the romance of <i>Erotokritos</i>, which was “the most popular reading
of the Levant from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century,” and in
which Herakles, “king of Athens,” his lovely daughter Aretousa, and
her lover Erotokritos are the principal figures, amidst a crowd of
princelets obviously modelled on the Frankish dukes and marquesses
of mediæval Greece. Other novelists were produced by the island, but
when Crete fell all the lettered Cretans left, and with their departure the
romantic spirit in literature, which they had imbibed from the West,
ceased<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>. A Greek school had been founded at Candia in 1550, and many
young Cretans went to Italy for purposes of study<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. Markos Mousouros,
the Cretan scholar, was buried in Sta Maria della Pace in Rome in 1517;
another Cretan, Skouphos, published his <i>Rhetoric</i> at Venice in 1681.
Compared with the present day, when the island has just emerged from
the deadening effect of 229 years of Turkish rule, its civilisation was
materially more advanced in Venetian times. The Venetians made roads,
bridges, and aqueducts; the Turks created nothing, and allowed the
former means of communication to decay. Yet, as we have seen, Venice
was never popular with the Cretans, and the reason is perfectly obvious
to those who have observed the Greek character. Be the material
advantages of foreign domination never so great, the Greek resents being
governed by those of another race and creed, especially if that creed be
Roman Catholicism. The history of the Ionian Islands under the British
Protectorate, of Cyprus under the existing arrangement, of the Morea
under the Venetians, of Athens and of Naxos under the Latin dukes, all
point the same moral. The patriotic Greek would rather be free than
prosperous, and most Greeks, though sharp men of business, are warm
patriots. That is the lesson of Venetian rule in Crete—a lesson which
Europe, after the agony of a century of insurrections, at last took to
heart by granting the Cretans autonomy—now become union with Greece.</p>

<h3 id="heading13">8. THE IONIAN ISLANDS UNDER VENETIAN RULE</h3>

<p>On their way from Venice to Constantinople the soldiers of the
fourth crusade cast anchor at Corfù, which (as modern Corfiote
historians think) had lately been recovered from the Genoese pirate
Vetrano by the Byzantine government, and was at that time, in the
language of the chronicler Villehardouin, “very rich and plenteous.”
In the deed of partition the Ionian islands were assigned to the Venetians;
but they did not find Corfù by any means an easy conquest. The natives,
combining with their old master, Vetrano, ousted the Venetian garrison,
and it was not till he had been defeated in a naval battle and hanged
with a number of his Corfiote supporters that the Republic was able to
occupy the island. Even then the Venetian government, finding it
impossible to administer directly all the vast territories which had
suddenly come into its possession, granted the island in fiefs to ten
Venetian citizens on condition that they should garrison it and should
pay an annual rent to the Republic. The rights of the Greek church were
to be respected, and the taxes of the loyal islanders were not to be raised<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>.
But this first Venetian domination of Corfù was of brief duration. When
Michael I Angelos founded the Despotat of Epeiros the attraction of a
neighbouring Greek state proved too much for the Corfiotes, who threw
off the Latin yoke and willingly became his subjects. A memorial of his
rule may still be seen in the splendidly situated castle of Sant’ Angelo,
whose ruins rise high above the waters of the Ionian Sea not far from the
beautiful monastery of Palaiokastrizza<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.</p>

<p>Corfù prospered greatly under the Despots of Epeiros. They took
good care to ratify and extend the privileges of the church, to grant
exemptions from taxation to the priests, and to reduce the burdens of
the laity to the smallest possible figure. In this they showed their
wisdom, for the church became their warmest ally, and a Corfiote divine
was one of the most vigorous advocates of his patron in the ecclesiastical
and political feud between the rival Greek empires of Nice and Salonika.
But after little more than half a century of Orthodox rule the island
passed into the possession of the Catholic Angevins. Michael II of Epeiros,
yielding to the exigencies of politics, had given his daughter in marriage
to the ill-starred Manfred of Sicily, to whom she brought Corfù as a part
of her dowry. Upon the death of Manfred at the battle of Benevento the
powerful Sicilian admiral Chinardo, who had governed it for his master,
occupied the island until he was murdered by the inhabitants at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
instigation of Michael. The crime did not, however, profit the crafty
Despot. The national party in Corfù endeavoured, indeed, to restore the
island to the rule of the Angeloi; but Chinardo’s soldiers, under the
leadership of a baron named Aleman, successfully resisted the agitation.
As the defeat of Manfred had led to the establishment of Charles of
Anjou as king of Naples and Sicily, and as they were a small foreign
garrison in the midst of a hostile population, they thought it best to
accept that powerful prince as lord of the island. By the treaty of
Viterbo the fugitive Latin emperor, Baldwin II, ceded to Charles any
rights over it which he might possess, and thus in 1267 the Angevins
came into possession of Corfù, though Aleman was allowed to retain the
fortresses of the place until his death<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. For more than five centuries the
Latin race and the Catholic religion predominated there.</p>

<p>The Angevin rule, as might have been anticipated from its origin,
was especially intolerant of the Orthodox faith. Charles owed his crown
to the Pope, and was anxious to repay the obligation by propagating
Catholicism among his Orthodox subjects. The Venetians, as we saw,
had enjoined the tolerance of the Greek church during their brief period
of domination, so that now for the first time the islanders learnt what
religious persecution meant. The Metropolitan of Corfù, whose office had
been so greatly exalted by the Despots of Epeiros, was deposed, and in
his room a less dignified ecclesiastic, called “chief priest” (μέγας
πρωτοπαπᾶς), was substituted. The title of “Archbishop of Corfù” was
now usurped by a Latin priest, and the principal churches were seized by
the Catholic clergy<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. In the time of the Angevins too the Jews, who still
flourish there almost alone in Greece, made their first appearance in any
numbers in Corfù, and first found protectors there; but the injunctions
of successive sovereigns, bidding the people treat them well, would seem
to show that this protection was seldom efficacious<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. The government
of the island was also reorganised. An official was appointed to act as
viceroy with the title of captain, and the country was divided into four
bailiwicks. Many new fiefs were assigned, while some that already
existed were transferred to Italians and Provençals.</p>

<p>The Sicilian Vespers, which drove the house of Anjou from Sicily
and handed that kingdom over to the rival house of Aragon, indirectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
affected the fortunes of Corfù. The Corfiotes did not, indeed, imitate the
Sicilians and massacre the French; but their connexion with the
Angevins now exposed them to attack from the Aragonese fleets. Thus
the famous Roger de Lluria burnt the royal castle and levied blackmail
upon the inhabitants. Another Roger, the terrible Catalan leader, De
Flor, ravaged the fertile island in one of his expeditions; yet, in spite of
these incursions, we find the condition of Corfù half a century later to
have been far superior to that of the neighbouring lands. The fact that
the diligent research of the local historians has brought to light so little
information about the Angevin period in itself proves that, in that
generally troubled time, Corfù enjoyed tranquillity. Beyond the names
of its sovereigns, Charles II of Naples, Philip I, Robert, and Philip II of
Taranto, Catherine of Valois and Marie de Bourbon, we know little
about the island from the time when Charles II, reserving to himself the
overlordship, transferred it as a fief in 1294 to his fourth son, the first
of those princes, down to the death of Philip II in 1373. It then experienced
the evils of a disputed succession, and, as it espoused the cause of
Queen Joanna I of Naples, it was attacked by the Navarrese mercenaries,
who were in the pay of the rival candidate, Jacques de Baux, and who
afterwards played so important a part in the Morea. When Joanna lost
her crown and life at the hands of Charles III of Durazzo, the latter
obtained Corfù, and, with the usual kindness of usurpers insecure on
their thrones, he confirmed the fiscal privileges which the Angeloi had
granted to the Corfiotes in the previous century<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. But after his violent
death four years later, in 1386, the decline of the Angevin dynasty and
the unsettled condition of the east of Europe caused the islanders to turn
their eyes in the direction of the only power which could protect them.</p>

<p>Venice indeed had never forgotten her brief possession of Corfù: she
had long been scheming how to recover so desirable a naval station, and
her consul encouraged the Venetian party in the island. There was also
a Genoese faction there, but its attempt to hold the old castle failed, and
on May 28, 1386, the Corfiotes hoisted the standard of St Mark. Six
envoys—one of them, it is worth noting, a Jewish representative of the
considerable Hebrew community—were appointed to offer the island to
the Republic upon certain conditions, the chief of which were the
confirmation of the privileges granted by the Angevins, a declaration
that Venice would never dispose of the place to any other power, and
a promise to maintain the existing system of fiefs. On June 9 a second
document was drawn up, reiterating the desire of the islanders, “or the
greater and saner part of them,” to put themselves under the shelter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
of the Republic. Since the death of Charles III, they said, “the island
has been destitute of all protection, while it has been coveted by jealous
neighbours on every side and almost besieged by Arabs and Turks.”
Wherefore, “considering the tempest of the times and the instability of
human affairs,” they had resolved to elect Miani, the Venetian admiral,
captain of the island, and he had entered the city without the least
disturbance. The castle of Sant’ Angelo held out for a time in the name
of Ladislaus, king of Naples; but the transfer of the island was effected
practically without bloodshed. On its side the Venetian government
readily agreed to the terms of the six Corfiote envoys, but thought it
prudent to purchase the acquiescence of the king of Naples in this
transaction. Accordingly in 1402 the sum of 30,000 gold ducats was
paid to him for the island, and the Venetian title was thus made doubly
sure<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>. For 411 years the lion of St Mark held unbroken possession of
Corfù.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fate of the other Ionian islands had been somewhat
different, and they only gradually passed beneath the Venetian sway.
Paxo, the baronial fief of the successive families of Malerba, Sant’ Ippolito
and Altavilla, was, indeed, joined politically with Corfù, from which it
is so short a distance, but Cephalonia, Zante, and Ithake had fallen
about the time of the Latin conquest of Constantinople into the hands
of a roving crusader or pirate—the terms were then identical—named
Majo, or Matthew, a member of the great Orsini clan and son-in-law of
the Sicilian Admiral Margaritone, who styled himself count palatine of
the islands, though he recognised the supremacy of Venice. Stricken
with pangs of conscience for his sins, he atoned for them by placing his
possessions under the protection of the Pope, who made short work of
the Orthodox bishops and put the islands under a single Latin ecclesiastic.
Majo did fealty to Geoffroy I de Villehardouin of Achaia, and the islands
were thenceforth reckoned as a vassal state of that principality. Historians
have narrated the horrible crimes of the descendants of Count
Majo in describing the stormy history of Epeiros, and so terrible was the
condition of the islands when John of Gravina set out to claim the
principality of Achaia that he had no difficulty in occupying them as
dependencies of that state. A few years later, in 1333, an arrangement
was made by which they were united with Achaia and Corfù under the
Angevin sceptre. But Robert of Taranto subsequently separated them
in 1357 from the latter island by conferring them upon Leonardo Tocco
of Benevento, who also became in 1362 duke of Santa Maura, an island
whose history during the thirteenth and part of the fourteenth centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
is buried in the deepest obscurity. It appears to have belonged to the
Despots of Epeiros down to a little before the year 1300, when it is
mentioned as a part of the county of Cephalonia. Captured by young
Walter of Brienne in his expedition to Greece in 1331, it was by him
bestowed on the Venetian family of Zorzi in 1355.</p>

<p>The Turks took the four islands of Cephalonia, Ithake, Zante, and
Santa Maura from the Tocchi in 1479, and the attempt of Antonio Tocco
to recover his brother’s dominions ended in his murder at the hands of
the Ionians. By arrangement with the Sultan the Venetians, who had
expelled Antonio’s forces, handed Cephalonia over to the Turks in
1485, but kept Zante, which thus, from 1482 onwards, was governed by
them, on payment of an annual tribute of 500 ducats to the Turkish
treasury<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. This tribute ceased in 1699, when the treaty of Carlovitz
formally ceded the island, free of payment, to the Republic. The
Venetians invited colonists to emigrate thither, in order to fill up the
gaps in the population; for the Turks had carried off many of the
inhabitants to Constantinople, for the purpose of breeding mulatto
slaves for the seraglio by intermarriage with negroes. As there were
many homeless exiles at the time, in consequence of the Turkish
conquests in the Levant, there was no lack of response to this invitation,
and Zante soon became a flourishing community. Its wealth was
further increased, in the sixteenth century, by the introduction of the
currant from the neighbourhood of Corinth, so that at that period it
merited its poetic title of “the flower of the Levant.” Cephalonia did
not long remain in Turkish hands. After two futile attempts to take it
the Venetians succeeded, in 1500, with the aid of the famous Spanish
commander, Gonsalvo de Cordoba, in capturing the island, and at the
peace of 1502-3 the Republic was finally confirmed in its possession,
which was never afterwards disturbed. Ithake seems to have followed
the fate of its larger neighbour. Santa Maura<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>, however, though taken
two years after Cephalonia, was almost at once restored to the Turks,
and did not become Venetian till its capture by Morosini in 1684, which
was ratified by the treaty of Carlovitz fifteen years later. It had long
been a thorn in the side of the Venetians, as it was, under the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
rule, a dangerous nest of pirates, against whom the Corfiotes more than
once fitted out punitive expeditions. When Santa Maura was reluctantly
given back to the Sultan in 1503, part of the population emigrated
to Ithake, then almost desolate<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>, and at the same time Cephalonia
received an influx of Greeks from the Venetian possessions on the mainland
which the Turks had just taken. Kythera, or Cerigo, which is not
geographically an Ionian island at all, and is no longer connected with
the other six, was the property of the great Venetian family of Venier,
which traced its name and origin from Venus, the goddess of Kythera,
from 1207, with certain interruptions and modifications, down to the
fall of the Republic. These Venetian Marquesses of Cerigo were ousted
by the Greeks under Licario after the restoration of Byzantine rule in the
South of the Peloponnese in 1262. The Emperor bestowed the island
upon Paul Monoyannes, a member of one of the three great Monemvasiote
families, but in 1309 intermarriage between the children of the
Greek and Latin lords restored it to the Venieri, who divided it up into
twenty-four shares. But the participation of the Venieri in the Cretan
insurrection of 1363 led to the transformation of their island into a
Venetian colony. Thirty years later, however, thirteen out of the twenty-four
shares were restored to them, while the Venetian Governor was
dependent upon the Cretan administration, so long as Crete remained
Venetian, and upon the Government of the Morea during the Venetian
occupation in the early part of the eighteenth century. After the peace
of Passarovitz he became the subordinate of the <i>provveditore generale del
Levante</i> at Corfù, and the former “eye of Crete” was thenceforth
treated as one of the seven Ionian Islands for the remainder of the
Venetian rule.</p>

<p>Besides the seven islands Venice also acquired, at different periods
after her occupation of Corfù, several dependencies on the mainland
opposite. Of these, owing to its dramatic history in the days of the
British protectorate, the most interesting was Parga, first taken in 1401<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.
As the landing-place for the famous rock of Suli, with which in a famous
line Byron has connected it, it was a place of some importance, and was
fortified by the Venetians as an outpost against the Turks. But the
Republic ultimately found that it cost more than it was worth, and
several times in vain urged the inhabitants to emigrate over the narrow
channel to Anti-Paxo, or to settle in Corfù. But then, as in 1819, the
Pargians showed a touching, if inconvenient, attachment to their
ancient home, perhaps not unmixed with the desire to continue the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
lucrative traffic of selling the munitions of war, sent from Venice for
their own defence, to the neighbouring Turks. Butrinto, opposite the
northern end of Corfù, had voluntarily surrendered to the Venetians
soon after their final occupation of that island, and, like Parga, was
fortified with works, of which the remains may still be seen. During the
Venetian rule of the Ionian Islands Butrinto, well known to sportsmen
for its duck-shooting, and to scholars for the allusion in the <i>Æneid</i><a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>, was
several times captured and recaptured. The fisheries in the lakes there,
which had once been the property of Cicero’s friend Atticus, were of
considerable value to the Venetians<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, as they are still to the present
proprietors; and the place became definitely assured to the Republic in
1718, at which date Vonitza inside, and Prevesa at the entrance of, the
Ambrakian Gulf, the latter a stronghold of corsairs and an important
military position which resisted the Greek bombardment during the
Greco-Turkish war of 1897, were also confirmed to Venice. The value
set by the Venetians upon these continental dependencies may be judged
from the fact that they were called “the eyes and ears of the Republic
on the mainland.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The administration of the islands during the Venetian period was
modelled on that of the Republic. In Corfù, the first occupied and most
important of the seven, the chief Venetian functionary was known as the
bailie, who was subsequently assisted by two noble Venetian councillors,
and by a third official, called <i>provveditore e capitano</i>, who was in command
of the garrison and resided in the fortress. The strong castle of Sant’
Angelo, on the west coast, which was never taken though often besieged,
was entrusted to a special officer. But the power of the bailie was soon
overshadowed by that of the commander of the fleet, which was soon
stationed at Corfù, and for which the arsenal at Govino, of which large
and imposing ruins still remain, was built. This naval authority was the
<i>provveditore generale del Levante</i>; he was usually appointed for three years,
and exercised very important functions at the time when Venice was
still a first-class eastern power. Strict orders were issued to all these
officials that they should respect the rights of the natives, and spies,
known as “inquisitors over the affairs of the Levant,” were sent from
time to time to the islands for the purpose of checking the Venetian
administration and of ascertaining the grievances of the governed, who
had also the privilege, which they often exercised, of sending special
missions to Venice to lay their complaints before the home government.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
Ionian historians, after due deduction is made for the strong Venetian
bias of the privileged class from which they sprang, are agreed that
redress was almost invariably granted, though the abuses of which the
natives complained were apt to grow up again. Thus when, in the early
part of the seventeenth century, the Corfiotes sent envoys to point out
the excesses committed by the sailors of the fleet the Venetian government
forbade the men to land on the island<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. Not long afterwards we
find the “inquisitors” ordering the removal of all statues and epitaphs
erected to the Venetian officials at Corfù, in order to prevent this slavish
practice, which had descended to the Greeks from the Roman days<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.
And somewhat later the exactions of the Venetian officials were stopped.
A large share in the local administration was granted to the inhabitants,
or rather to those of noble birth, for Corfiote society was divided into
the three classes of nobles, burghers, and manual labourers. At first
the so-called national council was a much more democratic body,
including many foreigners and local tradesmen. But the latter and their
children were gradually excluded from it, the entrance of the former was
restricted, and in 1440 the functions of the national council were strictly
limited to the annual election of a smaller body, the communal, or city,
council—a body composed at the outset of seventy, and, half a century
later, of 150 members, a total which was maintained till the last years of
Venetian rule, when the numbers were reduced to sixty. For the purposes
of this annual election the members of the national council met
in a quaint old house, decorated with pictures of Nausikaa welcoming
Odysseus, and of other scenes from the early history of Corcyra, and
situated between the old fortress and the town. This interesting
memorial of Venetian rule has long since been swept away.</p>

<p>The council of 150, which thus became the governing body of the
island, was composed of Greeks as well as Latins, and formed a close
oligarchy. Once only, during the crisis of the Candian war, it was
resolved to add to it those citizens who would pay a certain sum towards
the expenses of that costly struggle<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>. It had the right of electing every
year certain officials, called syndics (σύνδικοι), at first four in number—two
Greeks and two Latins—and at a later period, when the numbers
of the Latins had declined, only three. These syndics were required to be
more than thirty-eight (at another period thirty-five) years of age, and
were regarded as the special representatives of the community of Corfù.
Those who felt themselves wronged looked to them for redress, and, in
accordance with the economic heresies of that age, they regulated prices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
in the markets—a curious interference with the usual Levantine practice
of bargaining. The council of 150 also elected three judges, of whom one
must always be a Latin; but these officials possessed no more than a
consultative vote, and the real decision of cases rested with the bailie
and his two councillors. No local offices—and there were many in
Venetian days—were held for more than a year; most of them were
purely honorary, and all were in the gift of the council of 150. One of
the most important was that of <i>trierarch</i>, or captain of the Corfiote war
galleys, an official whom the Venetians wisely allowed these experienced
seamen, worthy descendants of the seafaring Phaiakians of the <i>Odyssey</i>,
to elect. Two campaigns entitled a Corfiote officer to the rank of captain
in the Republican fleet, and it would have been well if the British had
followed in this respect the example of their predecessors<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>, and thus
opened a naval career to the Ionians. The Corfiote nobles also commanded
the town militia, composed of about 500 artisans, and called “apprentices,”
or <i>scolari</i>, who received immunity from taxation in lieu of
pay and exercised on Sundays alone. Each village provided a certain
number of rural police. In imitation of the similar record at Venice a
Golden Book was established, containing the names of the Corfiote
nobles. When the latter were much diminished in numbers by the first
great siege of the island by the Turks in 1537 new families were added
to the list from the burgher class, and Marmora gives the names of 112
noble families existing at the time when he wrote his history, in 1672<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.
The Golden Book was burned as the symbol of hated class distinction
in the first enthusiasm for liberty, equality, and fraternity after the
French republicans took possession of Corfù.</p>

<p>The Venetians had found the feudal system already in existence
when they took over the island, where it had been introduced in Byzantine
days, and they had promised to maintain it. We are told by Marmora
that there were twenty-four baronies there in former times, and later
on the total seems to have been a dozen. In the last century of Venetian
rule there were fifteen<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>. Occasionally the Venetians created a new fief,
such as that of the gipsies, to reward public services. The Ἀθίγγανοι,
or gipsies, who were about 100 in number, were subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the baron, upon whom their fief had been bestowed, “an
office,” as Marmora says, “of not a little gain and of very great honour.”
They had their own military commander, and every year on May 1 they
marched under his leadership to the sound of drums and fifes, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
aloft their baron’s standard and carrying a maypole, decked with
flowers, to the square in front of the house where the great man lived.
There they set up their pole and sang a curious song in honour of their
lord<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, who provided them with refreshment and on the morrow received
from them their dues. Every feudatory was compelled to keep one horse
for the defence of the island, and was expected to appear with it on May
Day on parade. The peasants were worse off under this feudal system
than their fellows on the mainland under Turkish rule. They had no
political rights whatever; they were practically serfs, and were summed
up in the capitulations at the time of the Venetian occupation together
with “the other movable and immovable goods” of their lords<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. A
decision of the year 1641 that no one should vote in the council who had
not a house in the city must also have tended to produce absenteeism,
still one of the evils of Corfù, where at the present day only four landed
proprietors live on their estates. A distaste for country life, always a
marked feature of Greek society, may thus have been increased, and the
concentration of all the nobles and men of position in the town, which
is now ascribed at Corfù to the lucrative posts and gaieties of the capital
during the British protectorate, would seem to have begun much earlier.
Occasionally we hear of a peasants’ rising against their oppressors. Thus
in 1652 a movement of the kind had to be put down by force; but the
Venetian government, engaged at the time in the Candian war, did not
think it desirable to punish the insurgents. Somewhat earlier a democratic
agitation for granting a share in the local administration was
vetoed by the Republic. Marmora remarks in his time that “the
peasants are never contented; they rise against their lords on the
smallest provocation<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.” Yet, until the last century of her rule, Venice
had little trouble with the inhabitants. She kept the nobles in good
humour by granting them political privileges, titles, and the entrance
to the Venetian navy, and, so long as the Turk was a danger, she was
compelled, from motives of prudence, to pay a due regard to their
wishes. As for the other two classes of the population they hardly
entered into the calculations of Venetian statesmen.</p>

<p>No foreign government can govern Greeks if it is harsh to the national
church and clergy, and the shrewd Venetians, as might have been
anticipated, were much less bigoted than the Angevins. While, on the
one hand, they gave, as Catholics, precedence to the Catholic Church,
they never forgot that the interests of the Republic were of more
importance than those of the Papacy. Accordingly, in the Ionian islands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
no less than in Crete, they studiously prevented any encroachments on
the part of either the Œcumenical Patriarch or the Pope. Their ecclesiastical
policy is well expressed in an official decree, “that the Greeks
should have liberty to preach and teach the holy word, provided only
that they say nothing about the republic or against the Latin religion<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.”
Mixed marriages were allowed; and, as the children usually became
Orthodox, it is not surprising to learn that twenty years before the close
of the Venetian occupation there were only two noble Latin families in
Corfù which still adhered to the Catholic faith, while at Cephalonia
Catholicism was almost exclusively confined to the garrison<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. The
Venetians retained, however, the externals of the Angevin system. The
head of the Orthodox Church in Corfù was still called “chief priest”
(μέγας πρωτοπαπᾶς), while the coveted title of Archbishop was
reserved for the chief of the Catholic clergy. The “chief priest” was
elected by the assembled urban clergy and 30 nobles, and held office
for five years, at the end of which he sank into the ranks of the ordinary
popes, from whom he was then only distinguished by his crimson sash.
Merit had, as a rule, less to do with his election than his relationship
to a noble family and the amount of the pecuniary arguments which he
applied to the pockets of the electors, and for which he recouped himself
by his gains while in office. In each of the four bailiwicks into which
Corfù was then divided, and in the island of Paxo, there was a
πρωτοπαπᾶς, under the jurisdiction of the “chief priest,” who was
dependent upon no other ecclesiastical authority than that of the
Œcumenical Patriarch, with whom, however, he was only allowed to
correspond through the medium of the Venetian bailie at Constantinople.
Two liberal Popes, Leo X and Paul III, expressly forbade any interference
with the religious services of the Greeks on the part of the Latin
Archbishop; and upon the introduction of the Gregorian calendar it was
specially stipulated by Venice<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> that in the Ionian islands Latins as well
as Greeks should continue to use the old method of reckoning, in order
to avoid the confusion of two Easters and two Christmasses in one and
the same community. When we consider how strong, even to-day, is the
opposition of the Orthodox Church to the new style, we can understand
how gratifying this special exemption must have been to the Greeks of
that period.</p>

<p>From these causes there was less bitterness than in most other places
between the adherents of the two churches. The Catholics took part in
the religious processions of the Orthodox. When the body of St Spiridion
was carried round the town the Venetian authorities and many of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
garrison paid their respects to the sacred relics; twenty-one guns were
fired from the Old Fortress, and the ships in the harbour saluted; and
the enlightened Catholic Archbishop, Quirini, author of a work on the
antiquities of Corfù, actually went in full state to the Greek church of
St Spiridion on the festival of that saint<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. The Orthodox clergy reciprocated
these attentions by meeting the Catholics in the church of St
Arsenios, a tenth-century bishop and first Metropolitan of Corfù, where
the discordant chanting of Greeks and Latins represented their theological
concord, and by praying for the Pope and the Latin Archbishop at the
annual banquet at the latter’s palace. They were ready, also, to excommunicate
refractory villages at the bidding of the government, and
this practice, which filled the superstitious people with terror, was one
of the greatest social abuses of Corfù. It was put into force against
individuals on the least provocation, and we are told that the same
priest was quite willing to provide a counter-excommunication for a
consideration<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>The position of the Corfiote Jews, though far less favourable than
that of the Orthodox, was much better than that of the Hebrew colonies
in other parts of the Venetian dominions. In the very first days of the
Venetian occupation an order was issued to the officials of the Republic,
bidding them behave well to the Jewish community and to put no
heavier burdens upon them than upon the rest of the islanders. Many
of the Venetian governors found it convenient to borrow not only money,
but furniture, plate, and liveries from them. That they increased—owing
to the Jewish immigration from Spain and Portugal in 1492 and from
Naples and Calabria half a century later—in numbers under the
Venetians may be inferred from Marmora’s statement that in 1665 there
were about 500 Jewish houses in Corfù, and the historian, who shared to
the full the natural dislike for the Hebrew race which is so characteristic
of the Greeks and so cordially reciprocated by the Jews, naïvely remarks
that the Corfiote Jews would be rich if they were let alone<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. A century
later they had monopolised all the trade as middlemen, and the landed
proprietors were in their debt. They paid none of the usual taxes levied
on Jewish banks at Venice, and when, by the decree of 1572, the Jews
were banished from Venetian territory, a special exemption was granted
to those of Corfù. They were allowed to practise there as advocates, with
permission to defend Christians no less than members of their own race.
They had their own council and elected their own officials, and a law of
1614 prohibits the practice of digging up their dead bodies, under pain
of hanging. At the same time they had to submit to some degrading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
restrictions. They were compelled to wear a yellow mark on the breast,
or a yellow hat, as a badge of servitude, and an ordinance of 1532
naïvely remarks that this was “a substitute for the custom of stoning,
which does so much injury to the houses.” True, a money payment to
the treasury secured a dispensation from the necessity of wearing these
stigmas; but there was no exception to the rule which enjoined upon all
Jews residence in a separate part of the city, where they were divided
into two groups, each with its own synagogue. Even to-day the Jewish
quarter in the town of Corfù is known as the <i>Hebraïká</i>. Absurd tales
were current about them. Travellers were told that one of them was a
lineal descendant of Judas, and it was rumoured that a young Jewish
girl was about to give birth to a Messiah. They were not allowed to
possess real property or to take land or villas on lease, with the exception
of one house for the personal use of the lessee. But the effect of this
enactment was nullified by means of mortgages; and if a Jew wanted to
invest money in houses he had no difficulty in finding a Christian who
would purchase or rent them with borrowed Jewish capital. They were
expected to offer a copy of the law of Moses to a new Latin Archbishop,
who sometimes delighted the Corfiotes by lecturing them on their
shortcomings, and sometimes, like Quirini, was tolerant of their creed.
Finally, they were forbidden to indulge in public processions—an
injunction perhaps quite as much in their own interest as in that of the
public peace<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>The Venetian government did practically nothing for education
during the four centuries of its rule in the Ionian islands. No public
schools were founded, for, as Count Viaro Capodistria informed the
British parliament much later, the Venetian senate never allowed such
institutions to be established in the Ionian islands<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. The administration
was content to pay a few teachers of Greek and Italian in Corfù and one
in each of the other islands. There was also some private instruction to
be had, and the promising young men of the best families, eager to be
doctors or lawyers, were sent to complete their education at the university
of Padua. But the attainment of a degree at that seat of learning was
not arduous, for by a special privilege the Ionians could take their degree
without examination. And the Ionian student after his return soon
forgot what he had learned, retaining only the varnish of culture. There
were exceptions, however, to this low standard. It was a Corfiote who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
founded at Venice, in 1626, the Greek school, called Flangineion, after
the name of its founder, Flangines, which did so much for the improvement
of Greek education<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>; while it was a Cephalonian, Nikodemos
Metaxas, who about the same time set up the first Greek printing press
in Constantinople, which he had purchased in England<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>. But even in
the latest Venetian period there were few facilities for attaining knowledge
in Corfù. We are told that at that time reading and writing—the
highest attainments of the average Greek pope—could be picked up in
one of the monasteries, and Latin in the school of some Catholic priest,
but that there were no other opportunities of mental cultivation there.
The historian Mario Pieri, himself a native of Corfù, remarks that
towards the close of the eighteenth century, when he was a boy, there
were no public schools, no library, no printing press, and no regular
bookseller in the island, and the only literature that could be bought
there consisted of a grammar and a Latin dictionary, displayed in the
shop of a chemist<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. No wonder that the Corfiotes were easier to manage
in those days than in the more enlightened British times, when newspapers
abounded and some of the best pens in southern Europe were
ready to lampoon the British protectorate.</p>

<p>Yet, even under the Venetians, that love of literature which has
always characterised the Greeks did not become wholly extinct. Jacobo
Triboles, a Corfiote resident at Venice, published in the sixteenth century
in his native dialect a poem, the subject of which was taken from
Boccaccio, called the <i>History of the King of Scotland and the Queen of
England</i>. Another literary Corfiote, author of a <i>Lament for the Fall of
Greece</i>, was Antonios Eparchos, a versatile genius, at once poet, Hellenist,
and soldier, upon whom the fief of the gipsies was conferred for his
services<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. Several other Corfiote bards sang of the Venetian victories,
while, in 1672, Andrea Marmora, a member of a noble family still extant
in Corfù, published in Italian the first history of his country from the
earliest times to the loss of Crete by the Venetians. Subsequent writers
have criticised Marmora’s effusive style, his tendency to invent details,
his intense desire to glorify the most serene Republic<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. But his work is
quaintly written and he thoroughly reflects the feelings of his class and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
era. In 1725 Quirini, whom we have already mentioned as Latin Archbishop
of Corfù, issued the first edition of a Latin treatise on the
antiquities of his see, which was followed, thirteen years later, by a
second and enlarged edition. In 1656 an academy of thirty members,
known as the <i>Assicurati</i>, was founded at Corfù<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, and only succumbed
amid the dangers of the Turkish siege of 1716. A second literary society
was started about the same time, and a third saw the light in 1732.
Of the other islands Cephalonia produced in the seventeenth century
a priest of great oratorical gifts in the person of Elias Meniates. In short,
the Frankish influence, which had practically no literary result on the
mainland, was much more felt in the intellectual development of the
Ionians. But this progress was gained at the expense of the Greek
language, which, under the Venetians, became solely the tongue of the
peasants. Even to-day Greek is almost the only language understood
in the country districts of Corfù, while Italian is readily spoken in the
town. In the Venetian times the Venetian dialect was the conversational
medium of good society, and the young Corfiote, fresh from his easy-won
laurels at Padua, looked down with contempt upon the noblest and
most enduring of all languages. Yet it will never be forgotten in Corfù
that in the resurrection and regeneration of Greek two Corfiotes of the
eighteenth century, Eugenios Boulgaris and Nikephoros Theotokes,
played a leading part. The former in particular was the pioneer of Greek as
it is written to-day, the forerunner of the more celebrated Koraes, and he
dared to write, to the disgust of the clergy, in a language which the people
could understand. But, as his best work was done at Joannina, then the
chief educational centre of the Greek race, it concerns the general
history of Greece under the Turks rather than that of the seven islands<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>Ionian commerce was hampered by the selfish colonial policy then
prevalent in Europe, which aimed at concentrating all colonial trade in
the metropolis, through which the exports of the islands had to pass.
This naturally led to a vast amount of smuggling, even now rampant
in the Greek Archipelago, in which the British gained an unenviable
pre-eminence and for which they sometimes paid with their lives. The
oil trade, the staple industry of Corfù, was, however, greatly fostered by
the grant of 360 <i>drachmai</i> for every plantation of 100 olive trees, and we
find that, in the last half-century of the Venetian rule, there were nearly
two millions of these trees in that island, which exported 60,000 barrels
of oil every second year. The taxes consisted of a tithe of the oil, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
crops, and the agricultural produce, and a money payment on the wine,
a “chimney tax” on each house, and an export duty of 15 per cent. on
the oil, 9 per cent. on the salt, and 4 per cent. on other articles. There was
also an import duty of 6 per cent. on Venetian and of 8 per cent. on
foreign, goods. The revenue of Zante was so greatly benefited by the
introduction of the currant industry that it increased more than forty-fold
in the space of thirty years during the sixteenth century, and a
hundred years later the traveller Spon said it deserved the name of the
“island of gold” and called it “a terrestrial paradise.” But the wholesale
conversion of corn fields into currant plots caused such alarm that the
local authorities applied to Venice for permission to root up the currant
bushes by force. The Republic replied by allowing the currants to
remain, but at the same time levying a tax upon them, the proceeds of
which were devoted to the purchase and storage of bread stuffs. The
currant industry of that island was injured by further duties, and was
thus placed at a disadvantage as compared with the lightly taxed
currants of the Morea. But in the eighteenth century such numbers of
English ships came to Zante to load currants that the place had an
English consul, two English offices, and an English cemetery, while our
countrymen were very popular there<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>. One of the English families,
attracted thither by the currant trade, that of Sergeant, still flourishes
there. These public granaries were also instituted at Corfù, which
continued, however, to suffer severely from famines. At the time when
Zante was so prosperous Corfù was less productive, and we accordingly
hear that the Venetians obtained permission from the Pope to levy a
tithe on the goods of the Catholic clergy, in order to defray the costs of
maintenance. The salt pans of Levkimo, at the south of the island,
formed a government monopoly, and the importation of foreign salt
was punished by banishment<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. In order, perhaps, to counteract the
excessive usury of the Corfiote Jews, the government established an
official pawnshop<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>, where money was lent at a moderate rate of interest—6
per cent.</p>

<p>The administration of the other six islands was on similar lines to
that of Corfù. The nearest of them, Paxo, with its dependency, Anti-Paxo,
was treated as part of that island, and, as we have seen, the
Corfiote “chief priest” had ecclesiastical jurisdiction over it, just as
nowadays the Greek Archbishop of Corfù is also styled “of the Paxoi.”
In 1513, however, Paxo, together with the taxes which it paid,
was sold by the Venetians to the heirs of a Corfiote noble, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
treated its inhabitants so badly that many of them fled to Turkish
territory. At last the <i>provveditore generale del Levante</i>, under whose
province the affairs of these islands came, interfered, fixed the taxes
of Paxos at a certain sum, and appointed a native with a title of
<i>capitano</i> to govern it as the representative of the <i>provveditore e capitano</i>
at Corfù. Zante was administered during the first half-century of
Venetian rule by a single <i>provveditore</i>; but when the population had
considerably increased the Zantiotes, like the Cephalonians, had need
of further officials—two councillors and a secretary, all Venetian
nobles—who assisted the <i>provveditore</i>, and, like him, were appointed
for two years. In both Cephalonia and Zante there were a general
council, composed of the nobles, and a smaller council, whose
numbers were finally fixed in Zante at 150. The character of these
two islands, separated by such a narrow channel of sea, was, however,
widely different. Zante was much more aristocratic in its ideas,
though the feudal system, against which the popular rising of 1628
was directed, prevailed in both islands alike, where it had been introduced
by the Latin counts, Zante having twelve fiefs and Cephalonia
six<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>. But Cephalonia, owing to its purer Hellenic population, was
actuated by the democratic sentiments engrained in the Greek character.
The meetings of the Cephalonian council were remarkable for their
turbulence, of which the authorities frequently complained, and a
retiring governor of that island drew up a report to the home government
in 1754 in which he described in vivid colours the tendency of the
strong to tyrannise over the weak, which he had found common to all
classes, and which caused annoyance to the government and frequent
disturbances of the public peace<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. British officials had in turn a similar
experience, and Mr Gladstone discovered that the <i>vendetta</i> was not
extinct in the wild mountainous regions of Cephalonia when he visited
the Ionian islands on his celebrated mission. Venice fostered the
quarrels between the various parties at Argostoli, and governed the
unruly Cephalonians by means of their own divisions. In Zante the
number of the noble families, at first indefinite, was finally fixed at
ninety-three; and if any became extinct the vacancy was filled by the
ennoblement of a family of burghers. Once a year the <i>provveditore
generale del Levante</i> paid a visit of inspection to these islands; his arrival
was the greatest event of the whole calendar, and etiquette prescribed
the forms to be observed on his landing. He was expected to kiss first
the cross presented to him by the Latin bishop, and then the copy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
the Gospels offered to him by the spiritual head of the Orthodox community.</p>

<p>Leonardo Tocco had restored the Greek episcopal throne in Cephalonia,
and in the Venetian times, promoted to the rank of an archbishopric,
it continued to exist with jurisdiction over the Greeks at Zante and
Ithake, which was often disputed by the “chief priest” (πρωτοπαπᾶς)
of Zante, where a Latin bishop also resided. This dispute was at last
settled by a decree of the senate that the Cephalonian clergy should
retain the right to elect their prelate on condition of choosing a Zantiote
on every third vacancy<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. In Zante, as in Corfù, the Jews were a considerable
factor; at the close of the Venetian rule they numbered about
2000, and lived in a separate quarter of the city, walled in and guarded;
and the island was remarkable for the violent anti-Semitic riots of 1712<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>,
arising out of the usual fiction of the slaughtered Christian child, which
found their counterpart at Corfù in our own time. But the greatest evil
in these less important islands was that their <i>provveditori</i>, being chosen
from the poorer Venetian aristocracy, the so-called <i>barnabotti</i>, and
receiving small salaries, made up for their lack of means by corruption,
just as the Turkish officials do now. The efforts of the home government
to check the abuse of bribery, by forbidding its officials to receive
presents, were not always successful. The discontent of the lesser islands
found vent in the embassies which they had the right to send to Venice,
and we occasionally hear of their <i>provveditori</i> being detected in taking
bribes. More rarely the <i>provveditore generale</i> himself was degraded from
his high office for malversation. Accordingly the most recent Greek
historian of the fiscal administration of the islands under the Venetians,
considers that it was fortunate for them to have been taken, and lost, by
Venice when they were<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>Anything which concerns the supposed home of Odysseus must
necessarily be of interest, and fortunately we have some facts about
the government of Ithake at this period. We first hear of a Venetian
governor there in 1504, when the island had been repeopled by
emigrants from Santa Maura, and this official was assisted by two local
magnates, called “elders of the people” (δημογέροντες). In 1536 a life
governor was appointed, and upon his death, in 1563, a noble from
Cephalonia, appointed by the council of that island, was sent to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
administer it with the two “elders,” subject to the approval of the
<i>provveditore generale</i>, who visited Ithake every March. The Ithakans
twice successfully complained to Venice of their Cephalonian governors,
who were accused of extortion and of improper interference in local
affairs. Accordingly in 1697 the office was abolished, and thenceforth the
two Ithakan “elders” held sway alone, while every year the principal men
of the island met to elect the local officials. Small as it is, Ithake formed
one feudal barony<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>, of which the Galati were the holders, and its population
at the close of the Venetian period was estimated at about 7000.</p>

<p>Santa Maura was more democratic in its constitution than most of
the islands; for when Morosini took it from the Turks he permitted the
inhabitants to decide how they would be governed. Accordingly the
general council came in course of time to be largely composed of
peasants; but when, towards the close of the eighteenth century, the
Venetian government sent a special commissioner to reform the constitutions
of the seven islands he created a second and smaller council of
fifty at Santa Maura, to which the election of the local officials was
transferred. Venice was represented there by two <i>provveditori</i>, one of
whom had jurisdiction over the continental dependencies of Prevesa and
Vonitza, subject, however, to the supreme authority of the commander
of the fleet at Corfù<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>. Parga and Butrinto were entrusted to two officers
sent from the seat of the Ionian government; the former had its own
council, its own local officials, and paid neither taxes nor duties. All its
inhabitants were soldiers, and many of them pirates, and they were
known to imprison a Venetian governor, just as the Albanians of our
time besieged a Turkish <i>vali</i>, till they could get redress<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally the distant island of Kythera was administered by a Venetian
noble sent thither every two years. While it was a dependency of Crete
Kythera fell into a very bad state; its chief men indulged in constant
dissensions; the government was arbitrary, the garrison exacting. In
1572 an attempt was made to remedy these evils by the establishment of
a council of thirty members, elected on a property qualification, with
the power of electing the local authorities. A Golden Book was started,
and the natives were granted the usual privilege of appeal to the
Venetian government, either in Crete or at the capital. All the islands
shared with Corfù the right of electing the captains of their own galleys,
and they on more than one occasion rendered valuable services to the
Republic at sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>There had been, as we have noticed, a Genoese party at Corfù when
the fate of the island lay in the balance, and the commercial rivals of
Venice did not abandon all hope of obtaining so desirable a possession
until some time after the establishment of the Venetian protectorate.
Twice, in 1403 and again in 1432, they attacked Corfù, but on both
occasions without success. The first time they tried to capture the
impregnable castle of Sant’ Angelo, which was courageously defended
by a Corfiote noble. The second attempt was more serious. The invaders
effected a landing, and had already ravaged the fertile island, when a
sudden sally of the townsfolk and the garrison checked their further
advance. Many of the Genoese were taken prisoners, while those who
succeeded in escaping to their vessels were pursued and severely handled
by the Venetian fleet. The further attempts of Genoese privateers to
waylay merchantmen on their passage between Corfù and Venice were
frustrated, and soon the islanders had nothing to fear from these
Christian enemies of their protectors.</p>

<p>Although the Turks were rapidly gaining ground on the mainland,
they were repulsed in the attack which they made upon Corfù in 1431,
and did not renew the attempt for another century. Meanwhile, after
the fall of Constantinople and the subsequent collapse of the Christian
states of Greece, Corfù became the refuge of many distinguished exiles.
Thomas Palaiologos, the last Despot of the Morea, and the historian
Phrantzes fled thither; the latter wrote his history at Corfù at the
instance of some noble Corfiotes, and lies buried in the church of Sts
Jason and Sosipater, where Caterina Zaccaria, wife of Thomas Palaiologos,
also rests. About the same time the island obtained a relic which
had the greatest influence upon its religious life. Among the treasures of
Constantinople at the moment of the capture were the bodies of
St Theodora, the imperial consort of the iconoclast emperor Theophilos,
and St Spiridion, the latter a Cypriote bishop who took a prominent part
at the council of Nice and whose remains had been transferred to
Constantinople when the Saracens took Cyprus. A certain priest,
Kalochairetes by name, now brought the bodies of the two saints to
Corfù, where they arrived in 1456. Upon the priest’s death his two
eldest sons became proprietors of the male saint’s remains, and his
youngest son received those of the female, which he bestowed upon the
community. The body of St Spiridion ultimately passed to the distinguished
family of Boulgaris, to which it still belongs, and is preserved
in the church of the saint, just as the body of St Theodora reposes in the
metropolitical church. Four times a year the body of St Spiridion is
carried in procession, in commemoration of his alleged services in having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
twice delivered the island from plague, once from famine, and once from
the Turks. His name is the most widespread in Corfù, and the number
of boys called “Spiro” is legion<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.</p>

<p>During the operations against the Turks at this period the Corfiotes
distinguished themselves by their active co-operation with their
protectors. We find them fighting twice at Parga and twice at Butrinto;
we hear of their prowess at the Isthmus of Corinth and beneath the walls
of Patras in 1463, when Venice, alarmed for the safety of her Peloponnesian
stations, called the Greeks to arms; and they assisted even in
the purely Italian wars of the Republic. It seems, indeed, as if, at that
period, the words of Marmora were no mere servile phrase: “Corfù was
ever studying the means of keeping herself a loyal subject of the
Venetians<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.” At last, after rather more than a century of almost
complete freedom from attack, the island was destined to undergo the
first of the two great Turkish sieges which were the principal events in
its annals during the Venetian occupation. In 1537 war broke out
between the Republic and Suleyman the Magnificent, at that time
engaged in an attack upon the Neapolitan dominions of Charles V.
During the transport of troops and material of war across the channel of
Otranto the Turkish and Venetian fleets came into hostile collision, and
though Venice was ready to make amends for the mistakes of her
officials the Sultan resolved to punish them for the insults to his flag.
He was at Valona, on the Albanian coast, at the time, and, removing his
camp to Butrinto, despatched a force of 25,000 men, under the command
of the redoubtable Barbarossa, the most celebrated captain in the
Turkish service, to take possession of the island. The Turks landed at
Govino, destroyed the village of Potamo, and marched upon the capital,
which at that time had no other defences than the old fort. That
stronghold and the castle of Sant’ Angelo were soon the only two points
in the island not in the power of the invaders. A vigorous cannonade
was maintained by Barbarossa from the site of the present town and
from the islet of Vido, but the garrison of 4000 men, half Italians and
half Corfiotes, under the command of Jacopo di Novello, kept up a brisk
reply. The Greeks, it was said, could not have fought better had they
been fighting for the national cause, and they made immense sacrifices
in their determination never to yield. In order to economise food they
turned out of the fortress the women, old men, and children, who went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
to the Turkish lines to beg for bread. The Turkish commander, hoping
to work on the feelings of the garrison, refused; so the miserable
creatures, repudiated alike by the besieged and besiegers, wandered
about distractedly between the two armies, striving to regain admission
to the fortress by showing their ancient wounds gained in the Venetian
service, and at last, when their efforts proved unavailing, lying down in
the ditches to die. Their sufferings contributed largely towards the
victory of the defenders, for while provisions held out in the fortress they
began to fail in the camp.</p>

<p>Sickness broke out among the half-starved Turks, and, after a stay
of only thirteen days in the island, they re-embarked. But in that short
time they had wrought enormous damage. They had ravaged the fair
island with fire and sword, and they carried away more than 20,000
captives<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>. The population was so greatly reduced by this wholesale
deportation that nearly forty years afterwards the whole island contained
only some 17,500 inhabitants, and rather more than a century
after this siege a census showed that the total was not more than 50,000—a
much smaller number than in classical days, when it is estimated to
have been 100,000. In 1761 it had declined to 44,333; at the end of the
Venetian occupation it was put down at 48,000; a century later, in 1896,
it was 90,872<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. At the census of 1907 it was 94,451. Butrinto and Paxo,
less able to defend themselves than Corfù, fell into the hands of the Turks,
who plundered several of the other Ionian islands. Great was the joy of
Venice at the news that the invaders had abandoned Corfù, and public
thanksgivings were offered up for the preservation of the island, even
in the desolate condition in which the Turks had left it. A Corfiote,
named Noukios, secretary of an Ambassador of Charles V and author of
three books of travels, the second of which, relating to England, has been
translated into English, wrote, with tears in his eyes, a graphic account
of this terrible visitation.</p>

<p>One result of this invasion was the tardy but systematic fortification
of the town of Corfù, at the repeated request of the Corfiote council,
which sent several embassies to Venice with that object. More than 2000
houses were pulled down in the suburb of San Rocco to make room for
the walls, for which the old classical city, Palaiopolis, as it is still called,
provided materials, and Venice spent a large sum on the erection of new
bastions. Two plans are in existence showing the fortifications of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
citadel and of the town about this period<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, and some parts of the present
Fortezza Vecchia date from the years which followed this first Turkish
siege. The still existing Fortezza Nuova was built between 1577 and
1588, when the new works were completed. Another result of the Turco-Venetian
war was the grant of lands at Corfù to the Greek soldiers, or
<i>stradioti</i>, who had formed the Venetian garrisons of Monemvasia and
Nauplia, and for whom provision had to be made when, in 1540, the
Republic ceded these two last of her Peloponnesian possessions to the
sultan. The present suburb of Stratia still preserves the name of these
soldiers. The loss of the Venetian stations in the Morea and the subsequent
capture of Cyprus by the Turks naturally increased the numbers
of the Greeks in Corfù.</p>

<p>Shortly before the battle of Lepanto the Turks raided Kythera,
Zante, and Cephalonia, and again landed in Corfù. But the memory
of their previous failure and the fact that the garrison was prepared for
resistance deterred them from undertaking a fresh siege. They accordingly
contented themselves with plundering the defenceless villages, but this
time did not carry off their booty with impunity. Their ships were
routed; as they were departing many of them sank, and in Marmora’s
time the sunken wrecks could still be seen when the sea was calm<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. In
the battle of Lepanto 1500 Corfiote seamen took part on the Christian
side, and four ships were contributed by the island and commanded by
natives. One of these Corfiote captains was captured during the engagement
and skinned alive, his skin being then fastened as a trophy to the
rigging of one of the Turkish vessels. Another, Cristofalo Condocalli,
captured the Turkish admiral’s ship, which was long preserved in the
arsenal at Venice, and he received as his reward a grant of land near
Butrinto, together with the then rare title of <i>cavaliere</i>. The criticisms
which Finlay, after his wont, has passed upon the Greeks at Lepanto,
and which do not agree with the testimony of a contemporary Venetian
historian, certainly do not affect the conduct of the Ionians<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. A little
later, when the Turks again descended upon Corfù, they were easily
repulsed, and the long peace which then ensued between Venice and the
Porte put an end to these anxieties. Both the Corfiotes and the local
militia of Zante did service about this time under the banner of St Mark
in Crete; but the fearful losses of the Zantiotes, of whom eighty only out
of 800 returned home alive from the Cretan mountains, made the
peasants reluctant to serve again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>There are few facts to relate of the Ionian islands during the
peaceful period between the battle of Lepanto and the war of Candia.
At Corfù the peace was utilised for the erection of new buildings; the
church of St Spiridion was finished, and the body of the saint transferred
to it<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>. But the town did not strike the Venetian traveller Pietro della
Valle, who visited it early in the seventeenth century, as a desirable
residence. Both there and at Zante he thought the buildings were more
like huts than houses, and he considered the latter island barren and no
longer deserving of its classical epithet of “woody<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>.” It was about this
time that the Venetians introduced the practice of tournaments, which
were held on the esplanade, and at which the Corfiote nobles showed
considerable skill. Rather later the island was visited by the plague,
which was stayed, according to the local belief, through the agency of
their patron saint, who had on a previous occasion saved his good
Corfiotes from famine by inspiring the captains of some corn ships to
steer straight for their port. The first two of the four annual processions
were the token of the people’s gratitude for these services<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p>When the Candian war broke out further fortifications were built at
Corfù as a precautionary measure; but during the whole length of the
struggle the Turks came no nearer than Parga and Butrinto. The
Corfiotes were thus free to assist the Venetians, instead of requiring their
aid. Accordingly the Corfiote militia was sent to Crete, and horses and
money were given to the Venetian authorities for the conflict, while one
Corfiote force successfully held Parga against the enemy, and another
recaptured Butrinto. In fact the smallness of the population at the
census of that period was attributed to the large number of men serving
on the galleys or in the forts out of the island. When Crete was lost Corfù
naturally became of increased importance to the republic, and in the
successful war between Venice and Turkey, which broke out in 1684,
the Ionian islands played a considerable part. They were used as winter
quarters for the Venetian troops, and the huge mortars still outside the
gate of the Old Fortress at Corfù bear the memorable date of 1684, while
a monument of Morosini occupies, but scarcely adorns, the wall of the
old theatre. That gallant commander now led a squadron, to which the
three chief islands all contributed galleys, against the pirates’ nest of
Santa Maura. The countrymen of Odysseus are specially mentioned
among the 2000 Ionian auxiliaries, and the warlike bishop of Cephalonia
brought a contingent of over 150 monks and priests to the Republic’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
standard<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>. Santa Maura fell after a sixteen days’ siege; the capture of
Prevesa followed; and though the latter was restored to the Sultan with
dismantled fortifications by the treaty of Carlovitz, Santa Maura was
never again, save for a few brief months during the next war, a Turkish
island. The Venetians did not forget the Ionians, who had co-operated
with them so readily. Colonel Floriano, one of the Cephalonian commanders,
was granted the two islets of Kalamos and Kastos, off the
coast of Akarnania, famous in Homer as the abode of “the pirate
Taphians.” Thenceforth their inhabitants were bidden to pay to him
and his heirs the tithes hitherto due to the Venetian government. In
consequence of this he assumed the curious title of <i>conte della Decima</i>
(“count of the Tithe”), still borne by his descendants<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>. No wonder that
Venice was popular with an aristocracy to which it gave employment
and rewards.</p>

<p>The occupation of the Morea by the Venetians in the early part of
the eighteenth century secured the Ionians from disturbance so long as
the peace lasted; but when the Turks set about the re-conquest of the
peninsula they became involved in that last struggle between Venice
and Turkey. In 1715 the Turkish fleet took Kythera, the garrison of
which refused to fight, and the Venetians blew up the costly fortifications
of Santa Maura and removed the guns and garrison to Corfù, in
order that they might not fall into the hands of their foes<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. Alarmed at
the successes of the Turks, but unable in the degenerate condition of the
commonwealth to send a capable Venetian to defend the remaining
islands, the government, on the recommendation of Prince Eugène,
engaged Count John Matthias von der Schulenburg to undertake the
defence. A German by birth, and a brother of the duchess of Kendal,
mistress of our George I, Count von der Schulenburg did not owe his
career, strange as it may seem to us, to social influence or female intrigue.
Entering the Polish service, he had compelled the admiration of his
opponent, Charles XII of Sweden, and had afterwards fought with
distinction under the eyes of the duke of Marlborough at the siege of
Tournai and in the battle of Malplaquet. Armed with the rank of field-marshal,
he set out for Corfù, where he rapidly put the unfinished
fortifications into as good a condition as was possible in the time, and
paid a hurried visit to Zante for the same purpose. The approach of the
Turks hastened his return, for it was now certain that their objective
was Corfù. They had requisitioned the Epeirotes to make a wide road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
from Thessaly down to the coast opposite that island, traces of which
were in existence half a century ago<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>. Along this road Kara Mustapha
Pasha marched with 65,000 men, and effected a junction at Butrinto
with the Turkish fleet under Janum Khoja. In the narrow strait at the
north end of the island, opposite the shrine of the virgin at Kassopo,
which had taken the place of the altar of Jupiter Cassius, before which
Nero had danced, a division of the Venetian fleet engaged the Turkish
ships and cut its way through them into Corfù. But this did not prevent
the landing of 33,000 Turks at Govino and Ipso, who encamped along
the Potamo and made themselves masters of the suburbs of Mandoukio
and Kastrades, on either side of the town. Meanwhile Schulenburg had
armed all the inhabitants, including even the Jews, and we are specially
told that one of the latter distinguished himself so much as to merit the
rank of a captain<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>. But he wrote that he was “in want of every thing,”
and his motley garrison of Germans, Italians, Slavs, and Greeks was at
no time more than 8000 men. Even women and priests aided in the
defence, and one Greek monk, with a huge iron crucifix in his hands, was
a conspicuous figure as he charged the besiegers, invoking the vengeance
of God upon their heads.</p>

<p>The Turkish commander’s first object was to occupy the two
eminences of Mounts Abraham and San Salvatore, which commanded
the town, but had been carelessly left without permanent fortifications.
A first assault upon these positions was repulsed, but a second was
successful, and the Turks now called on Schulenburg to surrender. The
arrival of some reinforcements revived the spirits of the besieged, who
had now withdrawn from the town into the citadel, while the Turkish
artillery played upon the houses and aimed at the <i>campanile</i> of St
Spiridion’s church. The New Fortress was the point at which the enemy
now directed all their efforts; one of the bastions was actually taken,
and a poet has recorded that Muktar, grandfather of the famous Ali
Pasha of Joannina, fought his way into the castle and hung up his sword
on the gate<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>; but Schulenburg, at the head of his men, drove out the
Turks with enormous loss. He said himself that that day was the most
dangerous of his life; but his reckless daring saved Corfù. It was
expected that the Turks would renew the assault three days later; but
when the fatal morning broke, lo! they were gone. On the evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
before, one of those terrific showers of rain to which Corfù is liable about
the end of August descended upon the Turkish camp. The storm swept
away their baggage into the sea, and the panic-stricken Turks—so the
story ran-saw a number of acolytes carrying lighted candles, and an
aged bishop, who was identified with St Spiridion, pursuing the infidels
staff in hand. The murmurs of the janissaries and the news of a great
Turkish defeat on the Danube may have had more to do with the
seraskier’s hasty departure than the miraculous intervention of the
saint. But the Venetians, with true statesmanship, humoured the
popular belief that St Spiridion had protected the Corfiotes and themselves
in their hour of need. We can still see hanging in the church of
St Spiridion the silver lamp which the senate dedicated to the saint
“for having saved Corfù,” and a companion to which was provided by
the Corfiote nobles in memory of the safe arrival of the two divisions of
the fleet. The islanders still celebrate on August 11 (<span class="allsmcap">O.S.</span>), the anniversary
of the Turkish rout in 1716, the solemn procession of the saint, which
Pisani, the Venetian admiral, instituted in his honour<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.</p>

<p>The siege had lasted for forty-eight days, and the losses on both sides
had been very great. The lowest estimate of the Turkish dead and
wounded was 8000. Schulenburg put down his own casualties at 1500.
Moreover the Turks had left their artillery behind them, and in their
own hurried re-embarkation some 900 were drowned. The Venetian fleet,
under Pisani, whose indolence was in striking contrast to the energy of
Schulenburg, did not succeed in overtaking the foe; but Schulenburg
retook Butrinto, to which he attached much importance, and personally
superintended the re-fortification of Santa Maura, which another Latin
inscription still commemorates. The extraordinary honours paid to him
were the measure of Corfù’s value to the Republic. In his favour, as
in that of Morosini, an exception was made to the rule forbidding the
erection of a statue to a living person. Before the Old Fortress, which he
so gallantly defended, there still stands his image. Medals were struck
in his honour, and foreign sovereigns wrote to congratulate him. Nor did
his services to the Ionians end here. The fear of a fresh attack brought
him to Corfù again in the following year. From thence he made a
successful attack upon Vonitza and Prevesa, and those places, together
with Butrinto, Cerigo, and the islet of Cerigotto, or Antikythera, were
finally confirmed to the Republic at the peace of Passarovitz. After the
peace he drew up a systematic plan for the defence of the islands, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
considerations of expense prevented the Republic from carrying out as
fully as he wished. One restoration was imperative—that of the citadel
of Corfù, which was blown up by a flash of lightning striking the powder
magazine only two years after the great siege. Pisani and 1500 men lost
their lives in this accident; several vessels were sunk and much damage
done. Under Schulenburg’s directions these works were repaired. At the
same time, warned by the experience of the late siege, he strongly
fortified Mounts Abraham and San Salvatore and connected them with
subterranean passages<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. To pay for these improvements a tax of one-tenth
was imposed upon the wine and oil of the island<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. Large sums
were also spent in the next few years upon the defences of Zante, Santa
Maura, and the four continental dependencies of the islands. But the
Republic, having lost much of her Levant trade, could no longer keep
them up, and Corfù was again damaged by a second explosion in 1789.
About the middle of the eighteenth century there was a huge deficit in
the Ionian accounts, and the islands became a burden to the declining
strength of the Venetian commonwealth. On Corfù in particular she
spent twice what she got out of it.</p>

<p>The peace of Passarovitz in 1718, which made the useless island of
Cerigo the furthest eastern possession of Venice, practically closed the
career of the Republic as an oriental power, and thenceforth of all her
vast Levantine possessions the seven islands and their four dependencies
alone remained under her flag. The decadence of Turkey preserved them
to the Republic rather than any strength of her own, so that for the next
seventy-nine years they were unmolested. Yet this immunity from
attack by her old enemy caused Venice to neglect the welfare of the
Ionian islands, which were always best governed at the moment when
she feared to lose them. The class of officials sent from the capital during
this last period was very inferior. Poor and badly paid, they sought to
make money out of the islanders, and at times defrauded the home
government without fear of detection. M. Saint-Sauveur, who resided
as French consul in the Ionian islands from 1782 to 1799, has given a
grim account of their social and political condition in the last years of
Venetian rule; and, after due deduction for his obvious bias against the
fallen Republic, there remains a large substratum of truth in his statements.
At Zante the cupidity of the Venetian governors reached its
height. Nowhere was so little of the local revenue spent in the locality,
nowhere were the taxes more oppressive or more numerous; nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
were the illicit gains of the Venetian officials larger. They were wont to
lend money at usurious interest to the peasants, who frequently rose
against their foreign and native oppressors—for the nobles and burgesses
of that rich island were regarded by the tillers of the soil with intense
hatred. Murders were of daily occurrence at Zante; most well-to-do
natives had <i>bravi</i> in their pay; there was a graduated tariff for permission
to wear weapons; and Saint-Sauveur was once an eye-witness of an
unholy compact between a high Venetian official and a Zantiote who
was desirous to secure in advance impunity for his intended crime<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.
It is narrated how the wife of a Venetian governor of Zante used to
shout with joy “Oil, oil!” as soon as she heard a shot fired, in allusion
to the oil warrants, the equivalent of cash, which her husband received
for acquitting a murderer. Justice at this period was more than usually
halting. The French consul could only remember three or four sentences
of death during the whole of his residence in the islands, and when, a
little earlier, the crew of a foreign ship was murdered in the channel of
Corfù by some islanders under the leadership of a noble, only one
scapegoat, and he a peasant, was punished. Pirates were not uncommon,
Paxo being one of their favourite haunts. Yet after the peace of
Passarovitz Corfù was the centre of the Republic’s naval forces, and it
was in the last years of Venetian rule that many of the present buildings
were built at Govino, and a road was at last constructed from that point
to the town<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.</p>

<p>During the Russo-Turkish war between 1768 and 1774 many
Ionians took part in the insurrectionary movement against the Turks
on the mainland, in spite of the proclamations of the Venetian government,
which was anxious, like the British protectorate fifty years later,
to prevent its subjects from a breach of neutrality<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>; but it could not
even control its own officials, for a <i>provveditore generale</i> sold the ordnance
and provisions stored at Corfù under his charge to the Russians. The
sympathy of the Ionians for Orthodox Russia was natural, especially
as many Greeks from the Turkish provinces had settled in the islands
without having forgotten their homes on the mainland. They took part
in the sieges of Patras and Koron, while after the base desertion of the
Greeks by the Russians the islands became the refuge of many defeated
insurgents. These refugees were, however, delivered up by the Venetians
to the Turks, and nothing but a vigorous Russian protest saved from
punishment two Ionian nobles who had taken up arms on her side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Russia followed up her protest by appointing Greeks or Albanians as
her consuls in the three principal islands<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>; many Cephalonians emigrated
to the new Russian province of the Crimea, and Cephalonian merchantmen
began to fly her flag. During the next Russo-Turkish war—that
between 1787 and 1792—the Ionians fitted out corsairs to aid their
friends, and a Russian general was sent to Ithake to direct the operations
of the Greeks. Two of the latter, Lampros Katsones of Livadia
and the Lokrian Androutsos, father of the better known klepht Odysseus,
were specially conspicuous. Lampros styled himself “king of Sparta,”
and christened his son Lycurgus. He established himself on the coast
of Maina and plundered the ships of all nations—a patriot according to
some, a pirate according to others. When a French frigate had put an
end to his reign of terror he, like Androutsos, fled to the Ionian islands.
The Venetians caused a hue and cry to be raised for his followers, who
were saved from the gallows by their Russian patrons; but Androutsos
was handed over to the Turks, who left him to languish in prison at
Constantinople. Katsones became the hero of a popular poem.</p>

<p>The attacks of pirates from Barbary and Dulcigno upon Prevesa
and Cerigo roused the Venetians to the necessity of punishing those
marauders, and accordingly Angelo Emo was appointed “extraordinary
captain of the ships” and sent to Corfù. After a vigorous
attempt at reforming the naval establishment there, which had fallen
into a very corrupt state, he chastised the Algerines and Tunisians, to
the great relief of the Ionians. The Zantiotes “presented him with a gold
sword, and struck a medal in his honour”; in Corfù a mural tablet still
recalls his services against the Barbary corsairs, and his name ranks
with those of Morosini and Schulenburg in the history of the islands<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>.</p>

<p>The long peace of the eighteenth century had marked results upon
the social life of the Ionians. It had the bad effect, especially at Corfù,
of increasing the desire for luxuries, which the natives could ill afford,
but which they obtained at the sacrifice of more solid comfort. Anxious
to show their European culture, the better classes relinquished the garb
of their ancestors, and the women, who now for the first time emerged
from the oriental seclusion in which they had been kept for centuries
in most of the islands, deprived themselves of necessaries and neglected
their houses in order to make a smart appearance on the esplanade—a
practice not yet extinct at Corfù. Yet this partial emancipation of the
Ionian ladies, due to the European habits introduced by the increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
number of Venetian officers who had married Corfiote wives, was a
distinct benefit to society. Gradually ladies went to the theatre; at first
they were screened by a <i>grille</i> from the public gaze, then a mask was
considered sufficient protection; finally that too was dropped<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. The
population of the islands and their dependencies in 1795 was put down
at 152,722. But Corfù was already in the deplorable state of poverty
into which it once more relapsed after the withdrawal of the British.
In spite of its splendid climate and its fertile soil the fruitful island of
the Phaiakians at the end of the Venetian rule could not nourish its much
smaller number of inhabitants for more than four or five months in the
year. The fault did not lie with the soil; but few of the proprietors had
the capital to make improvements, and few of the peasants had the
energy or the necessary incentives to labour. The lack of beasts of burden
and of carriageable roads was a great drawback. One governor did at
last, in 1794, construct five roads from the town into the country, by
means of voluntary subscriptions and a tax on every loaded horse
entering the streets<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. But it was not till the British time that either this
or the scarcely less evil of want of water was remedied. The successors
of the seafaring subjects of Alkinoös had scarcely any mercantile marine,
while the Cephalonians, sons of a less beautiful island, voyaged all over
the Levant in search of a livelihood. An attempt to naturalise sugar,
indigo, and coffee in a hollow of the Black Mountain was a failure<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>. Zante,
less luxurious and naturally richer than either of her two other greater
sisters, suffered during the Anglo-French war from the absence of
English commerce; and repeated earthquakes, the predecessors of that
of 1893, caused much damage there<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>. As might have been expected the
Venetian system had not improved the character of the islanders, whose
faults were admitted by their severest critics to be due to the moral
defects of the government. If the Corfiotes of that day seemed to Saint-Sauveur
to be ignorant and superstitious, poor and indolent, they were
what Venice had made them. Yet, in spite of all her errors, the Republic
had given to the seven islands a degree of civilisation which was lacking
in Turkish Greece, and which, improved by our own protectorate, still
characterises the Ionians to-day. Corfù and Zante are still, after over
fifty years of union with the Hellenic kingdom, in many respects more
Italian than Greek. Even to-day the seal of Venice is upon them; not
merely does the lion of St Mark still stand out from their fortifications,
but in the laws and the customs, in the survival of the Italian language
and of Italian titles of nobility here almost alone in Greece, we can trace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
his long domination. But no Corfiote or Zantiote, for all that, desires to
become Italian.</p>

<p>The French Revolution had little immediate influence upon the
Ionian islands, though there were some disturbances at Zante, and the
citizens of Corfù petitioned Venice against the exclusive privileges of the
nobles. Three years before the outbreak in Paris, the most serene
Republic had sent a special commissioner to reform the constitution of
the islands; but those reforms mainly consisted in reducing the numbers
of the councils at Corfù and Santa Maura. Much greater hopes were
formed in 1794 on the arrival of Widman, the last <i>provveditore generale</i>
whom Venice sent to Corfù. Widman had had a distinguished naval
career; his benevolence was well known by report, and the Corfiotes,
who had been plundered by his rapacious predecessor, gave him a
reception such as had never fallen to the lot of any of their previous
Venetian governors<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>. It was fortunate for him that he was so popular,
for, after selling his own silver to meet the pressing needs of the
administration, he had to appeal to the generosity of the Ionians for
funds to carry on the government. He did not appeal in vain; the
inhabitants of the three chief islands subscribed money; the four
continental dependencies, having no money, offered men, who could not,
however, be accepted, as there were no uniforms available; the Jews
gave him over £400 and armed a certain number of soldiers at their
expense; he was even reduced, as he could get nothing but promises from
home, to use up the savings-bank deposits in the public service. In the
apology which he published two years after the loss of the islands he
gave a black picture of the state of the fortifications, which contained
scarcely enough powder for a single man-of-war. Under the circumstances
his sole consolation was the perusal of St Augustin. Such was
the condition of the Ionian defences when the French troops entered
Venice in 1797<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>.</p>

<p>Venice was preparing to send commissioners with powers to establish
a democratic form of government at Corfù, when Bonaparte, fearing lest
Russia should occupy the islands, ordered General Gentili to go thither
at once, bidding him introduce some telling classical allusions in his
proclamation to the islanders. In the guise of an ally of Venice, with
Venetian forces mixed among his own, and flying the lion banner of
St Mark at his mast-head, Gentili sailed into Corfù on July 11. He
informed Widman that he had come to protect the islands, and asked
that room might be found within the fortress for their new protectors;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
he told the people in a trilingual proclamation that the French Republic,
in alliance with the Venetians, would free this fragment of ancient Hellas,
and revive the glories and the virtues of classic times. Catching the
classical spirit of the general’s proclamation, the head of the Orthodox
church met him as he landed and presented him with a copy of the
<i>Odyssey</i>. The islanders received the French as saviours. Gentili occupied
the citadel, and Bonaparte wrote from Milan that they hoped “to
regain, under the protection of the great French nation, the sciences,
arts, and commerce which they had lost through oligarchical tyranny.”</p>

<h3 id="heading14">9. MONEMVASIA<br />
MONEMVASIA DURING THE FRANKISH PERIOD (1204-1540)</h3>

<p>There are few places in Greece which possess the combined charms
of natural beauty and of historic association to the same extent as
Monemvasia. The great rock which rises out of the sea near the ancient
Epidauros Limera is not only one of the most picturesque sites of the
Peloponnese, but has a splendid record of heroic independence, which
entitles it to a high place in the list of the world’s fortresses (Plate II,
Figs. 1, 2). Monemvasia’s importance is, however, wholly mediæval;
and its history has hitherto never been written; for the painstaking
brochure of the patriotic Monemvasiote ex-deputy and ex-Minister
K. Papamichalopoulos<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>, was composed before modern research rendered
it possible to draw upon the original authorities at Venice and elsewhere.
In the present chapter I have endeavoured to state briefly what, in the
present state of Greek mediæval studies, is known about this interesting
city during the Frankish period.</p>

<p>At the time of the Frankish Conquest of the rest of Greece, Monemvasia
was already a place of considerable importance. Even if we reject
the statement of the fifteenth century historian, Phrantzes<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>, himself a
native of the place, that the Emperor Maurice had raised it to the rank
of the 34th Metropolitan see—a statement contradicted by an ecclesiastical
document of 1397—we know at least that it was even then the
seat of a Greek bishopric, whose holder remained a suffragan of Corinth<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
till the Latins captured the latter city in 1210. The Comneni had confirmed
the liberties of a community so favourably situated, and the local<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
aristocracy of Monemvasia enjoyed the privilege of self-government.
Thanks to the public spirit of its inhabitants, the wisdom of the local
magnates, and the strength of its natural defences, which made it in the
Middle Ages the Gibraltar of Greece, it had repelled the attack of the
Normans from Sicily in the middle of the twelfth century. Fifty years
later it was a busy sea-port town, whose ships were seen at the Piræus
by Michael Akominatos, the last Metropolitan of Athens before the
Conquest, and whose great artistic treasure, the famous picture of Our
Lord being “dragged,” which has given its name to the Ἑλκόμενος
church, attracted the covetousness of the Emperor Isaac II<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>.</p>

<p>As might have been expected from its position and history, Monemvasia
was the last spot in the Peloponnese to acknowledge the Frankish
supremacy. Geoffroy I Villehardouin had contented himself perforce
with sending a body of troops to raid the country as far as the causeway,
or μόνη ἔμβασις, which leads to the great rock-fortress and from
which its name is derived<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>; and his son Geoffroy II seems to have
meditated the conquest of the place<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>; but it was reserved for the third
of the Villehardouins, soldierly Prince William, to hoist the <i>croix ancrée</i>
of his family over the “sacred rock” of Hellenism, which was in uninterrupted
communication by sea with the successor of Byzantium, the
Greek Emperor of Nice<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>, and was therefore a constant source of annoyance
to the Franks of the Peloponnese. The Prince, after elaborate
preparations, began the siege not long after his accession in 1246. He
summoned to his aid the great vassals of the Principality—Guy I of
Athens, who owed him allegiance for Nauplia and Argos; the three barons
of Eubœa; Angelo Sanudo, Duke of Naxos, with the other lords of the
Cyclades, and the veteran Count Palatine of Cephalonia, Matteo Orsini,
ruler of the island-realm of Odysseus<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>. But the Prince of Achaia saw
that without the naval assistance of Venice, which had taken care that
his principality should not become a sea-power, he could never capture
the place. He accordingly obtained the aid of four Venetian galleys, and
then proceeded to invest the great rock-fortress by land and water. For
three long years the garrison held out, “like a nightingale in its cage,” as
the Chronicler quaintly says—and the simile is most appropriate, for
the place abounds with those songsters—till all supplies were exhausted,
and they had eaten the very cats and mice. Even then, however, they
only surrendered on condition that they should be excused from all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
feudal services, except at sea, and should even in that case be paid. True
to the conciliatory policy of his family, William wisely granted their
terms, and then the three <i>archontes</i> of Monemvasia, Mamonas, Daimonoyannes,
and Sophianos, advanced along the narrow causeway to his camp
and offered him the keys of their town. The conqueror received them with
the respect of one brave man for another, loaded them with costly gifts,
and gave them fiefs at Vatika near Cape Malea. A Frankish garrison
was installed in the coveted fortress; and a Latin bishop, Oddo of Verdun,
at last occupied the episcopal palace there, which had been his (on paper)
ever since Innocent III<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> had organised the Latin see of Monemvasia as
one of the suffragans of Corinth.</p>

<p>The Frankish occupation lasted, however, barely fourteen years, and
has left no marks on the picturesque town. Buchon, indeed, who spied
the Villehardouin arms on the Gorgoepekoos church at Athens, thought
that he had discovered the famous <i>croix ancrée</i> on one of the churches<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.
He apparently meant the Ἑλκόμενος church, which the late Sir T. Wyse
called and Murray’s <i>Handbook</i> still calls St Peter’s—a name not now
known in Monemvasia, but derived perhaps from an inscription to a
certain <i>Dominus Petrus</i>, whose remains “lie in peace” hard by. One
church in the town, “Our Lady of the Myrtle,” bears, it is true, a cross
with anchored work below, and four stars above the door. But this
church, as I was informed and as the name implies, was founded by
people from Cerigo, whose patron saint is the Παναγία Μυρτιδιώτισσα
(Plate III, Fig. 1). The capture of the town by the Franks is, however, still
remembered at Monemvasia, and local tradition points out the place on
the mainland where Villehardouin left his cavalry. One pathetic event
occurred at the rock during the brief Frankish period—the visit of the
last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II, in 1261, on his way
from his lost capital to Italy<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>. In the following year Monemvasia was
one of the castles ceded to his successor, the Emperor Michael VIII
Palaiologos, as the ransom of Prince William of Achaia, captured by the
Greeks three years earlier after the fatal battle of Pelagonia.</p>

<p>The mediæval importance of Monemvasia really dates from this
retrocession to the Byzantine Emperor in 1262, when a Byzantine
province was established in the south-east of the Morea. It not only
became the seat of an Imperial governor, or κεφαλή, but it was the
landing-place where the Imperial troops were disembarked for operations
against the Franks, the port where the Tzakones and the <i>Gasmoûloi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
or half-castes, of the Peloponnese enlisted for service in the Greek navy.
During the war which began in 1263 between Michael VIII and his late
captive, we accordingly frequently find it mentioned; it was thither that
the Genoese transports in the Imperial service conveyed the Greek troops;
it was thither, too, that the news of the first breach of the peace was
carried post-haste, and thence communicated to Constantinople; it was
there that the Imperial generals took up their headquarters at the outset
of the campaign; and it was upon the Monemvasiotes that the combatants,
when they were reconciled, agreed to lay the blame for the war<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.
Under the shadow of the Greek flag, Monemvasia became, too, one of
the most dangerous lairs of corsairs in the Levant. The great local
families did not disdain to enter the profession, and we read of both the
Daimonoyannai and the Mamonades in the report of the Venetian
judges, who drew up a long statement in 1278 of the depredations
caused by pirates to Venetian commerce in the Levant. On one occasion
the citizens looked calmly on while a flagrant act of piracy was being
committed in their harbour, which, as the port of shipment for Malmsey
wine, attracted corsairs who were also connoisseurs<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>. Moreover, the
Greek occupation of so important a position was fatal to the Venetian
lords of the neighbouring islands, no less than to Venetian trade in the
Ægean. The chief sufferers were the two Marquesses of Cerigo and
Cerigotto, members of the great families of Venier and Viaro, who had
occupied those islands after the Fourth Crusade. It would appear from
a confused passage of the Italian Memoir on Cerigo, that the islanders,
impatient at the treatment which they received from their Latin lord,
the descendant, as he boasted, of the island-goddess Venus herself, sent
a deputation to invoke the aid of the Greek governor of the new
Byzantine province in the Morea<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>. At any rate, the famous cruise of
Licario, the upstart Italian of Negroponte who went over to the Greeks,
temporarily ended the rule of the Venetian Marquesses. A governor was
sent to Cerigo from Monemvasia; but ere long Michael VIII conferred
that island upon the eminent Monemvasiote <i>archon</i>, Paul Monoyannes,
who is described in a Venetian document as being in 1275 “the vassal
of the Emperor and captain of Cerigo.” Monoyannes fortified the island,
where his tomb was discovered during the British protectorate, and it
remained in the possession of his family till 1309, when intermarriage
between the children of its Greek and Latin lords restored Cerigo to the
Venieri<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</p>

<p>The Byzantine Emperors naturally rewarded a community so useful
to them as that of Monemvasia. Michael VIII granted its citizens
valuable fiscal exemptions; his pious son and successor, Andronikos II
not only confirmed their privileges and possessions, but founded the
church of the Divine Wisdom which still stands in the castle. The
adjoining cloister has fallen in ruins; the Turks after 1540 converted the
church, like the more famous Santa Sophia of Constantinople, into a
mosque, the <i>mihrab</i> of which may still be traced, and smashed all the
heads of the saints which once adorned the church—an edifice reckoned
as ancient even in the days of the Venetian occupation, when a Monemvasiote
family had the <i>jus patronatus</i> over it (Plate III, Fig. 2). But a fine
Byzantine plaque over the door—two peacocks and two lambs—still
preserves the memory of the Byzantine connexion. Of Andronikos II
we have, too, another Monemvasiote memorial—the Golden Bull of
1293, by which he gave to the Metropolitan the title of “Exarch of all
the Peloponnese,” with jurisdiction over eight bishoprics, some, it is
true, still <i>in partibus infidelium</i>, as well as the titular Metropolitan throne
of Side, and confirmed all the rights and property of his diocese, which
was raised to be the tenth of the Empire and extended, at any rate on
paper, right across the peninsula to “Pylos, which is called Avarinos”—a
convincing proof of the error made by Hopf in supposing that the name
of Navarino arose from the Navarrese company a century later. The
Emperor lauds in this interesting document, which bears his portrait
and is still preserved in the National Library and (in a copy) in the
Christian Archæological Museum at Athens, the convenience and safe
situation of the town, the number of its inhabitants, their affluence and
their technical skill, their seafaring qualities, and their devotion to his
throne and person. His grandson and namesake, Andronikos III, in
1332 granted them freedom from market-dues at the Peloponnesian
fairs<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>. But a city so prosperous was sure to attract the covetous glances
of enemies. Accordingly, in 1292, Roger de Lluria, the famous admiral
of King James of Aragon, on the excuse that the Emperor had failed to
pay the subsidy promised by his father to the late King Peter, descended
upon Monemvasia, and sacked the lower town without a blow. The
<i>archontes</i> and the people took refuge in the impregnable citadel, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
their property and their Metropolitan in the power of the enemy<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>. Ten
years later, another Roger, Roger de Flor, the leader of the Catalan
Grand Company, put into Monemvasia on his way to the East on that
memorable expedition which was destined to ruin “the pleasaunce of
the Latins” in the Levant. On this occasion the Catalans were naturally
on their good behaviour. Monemvasia belonged to their new employer,
the Emperor Andronikos; it had been stipulated that they should receive
the first instalment of their pay there; and Muntaner<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> tells us that the
Imperial authorities gave them a courteous reception and provided
them with refreshments, including probably a few barrels of the famous
Malmsey.</p>

<p>Monemvasia fortunately escaped the results of the Catalan expedition,
which proved so fatal to the Duchy of Athens and profoundly
affected the North and West of the Morea. Indeed, in the early part of
the fourteenth century the corsairs of the great rock seemed to have
actually seized the classic island of Salamis under the eyes of the Catalan
rulers of Athens, whose naval forces in the Saronic Gulf had been
purposely crippled by the jealous Venetian Government. At any rate
we find Salamis, which had previously belonged to Bonifacio da Verona,
the baron of Karystos in Eubœa, and had passed with the hand of his
daughter and heiress to Alfonso Fadrique, the head of the terrible
Catalan Company in Attica, now paying tribute to the Byzantine
governor of Monemvasia<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>. When, however, towards the end of the
fourteenth century, the Greeks began to recover most of the Peloponnese,
the city which had been so valuable to them in the earlier days of the
reconquest of the Morea had to compete with formidable rivals. In
1397, when Theodore I Palaiologos obtained, after a desperate struggle,
the great fortress of Corinth, which had been his wife’s dowry from her
father, Nerio Acciajuoli, his first act was to restore the Metropolitan see
of that ancient city, and the first demand of the restored Metropolitan
was for the restitution to him by his brother of Monemvasia of the two
suffragan bishoprics of Zemenos and Maina, which had been given to the
latter’s predecessor after the Latin conquest of Corinth<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. This demand
was granted, and we are not surprised to hear that the Monemvasiotes
were disaffected to the Despot, under whom such a slight had been cast
upon their Church. The Moreote <i>archontes</i> at this period were intensely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
independent of the Despot of Mistra, even though the latter was the
brother of the Emperor. The most unruly of them all was Paul Mamonas
of Monemvasia, who belonged to the great local family which had been
to the fore in the days of Villehardouin. This man held the office of
“Grand-Duke” or Lord High Admiral in the Byzantine hierarchy of
officials and claimed the hereditary right to rule as an independent
princelet over his native city, of which his father had been Imperial
governor. When Theodore asserted his authority, and expelled the
haughty <i>archon</i>, the latter did not hesitate to arraign him before the
supreme authority of those degenerate days—the Sultan Bayezid I who
ordered his immediate restoration by Turkish troops—a humiliation
alike for the Greek Despot and for the sacred city of Hellenism<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.
Theodore had, indeed, at one time thought of bestowing so unruly a
community upon a Venetian of tried merit; and, in 1419, after the death
of Paul’s son, the Republic was supposed by Hopf to have come into
possession of the coveted rock and its surroundings—then a valuable
commercial asset because of the Malmsey which was still produced
there<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. But the three documents, upon which he relies for this statement,
merely show that Venetian merchants were engaged in the wine-trade
at Monemvasia.</p>

<p>It was at this period that Monemvasia produced two men of letters,
George Phrantzes and the Monk Isidore. To the latter we owe a series
of letters, one of which, addressed to the Emperor Manuel II on the
occasion of his famous visit to the Morea in 1415, describes his pacification
of Maina and his abolition of the barbarous custom of cutting off the
fingers and toes of the slain, which the Mainates had inherited from the
Greeks of Æschylus and Sophocles. He also alludes to the Greek
inscriptions which he saw at Vitylo<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. Of Phrantzes, the historian of the
Turkish conquest, the secretary and confidant of the Palaiologoi, the
clever if somewhat unscrupulous diplomatist, who, after a busy life, lies
buried in the quiet church of Sts Jason and Sosipater at Corfù, it is
needless to speak. In the opinion of the writer, Phrantzes should hold
a high place in Byzantine history. His style is clear and simple, compared
with that of his contemporary Chalkokondyles, the ornate
Herodotus of the new Persian Conquest; he knew men and things; he
was no mere theologian or rhetorician, but a man of affairs; and he wrote
with a <i>naïveté</i>, which is as amusing as it is surprising in one of his
profession. Monemvasia may be proud of having produced such a man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
who has placed in his history a glowing account of his birthplace. We
hear too in 1540 of a certain George, called “Count of Corinth” but a
native of Monemvasia, who had a fine library, and among the many
Peloponnesian calligraphists, the so-called “Murmures,” found later on
in Italy, there were some Monemvasiotes<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.</p>

<p>We next find Monemvasia in the possession of the Despot Theodore
II Palaiologos<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>, who ratified its ancient privileges. All the Despot’s
subjects, whether freemen or serfs, were permitted to enter or leave this
important city without let or hindrance, except only the dangerous
denizens of Tzakonia and Vatika, whose character had not altered in the
two hundred years which had elapsed since the time of Villehardouin.
The citizens, their beasts, and their ships were exempt from forced
labour; and, at their special request, the Despot confirmed the local
custom, by which all the property of a Monemvasiote who died without
relatives was devoted to the repair of the castle; while, if he had only
distant relatives, one-third of his estate was reserved for that purpose
(Plate V, Fig. 1). This system of death duties (τὸ ἀβιωτίκιον, as it was
called) was continued by Theodore’s brother and successor, Demetrios,
by whom Monemvasia was described as “one of the most useful cities
under my rule<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>.” Such, indeed, he found it to be, when, in 1458,
Mohammed II made his first punitive expedition into the Morea. On
the approach of the great Sultan, the Despot fled to the rock of Monemvasia.
It was the ardent desire of the Conqueror to capture that famous
fortress, “the strongest of all cities that we know,” as the contemporary
Athenian historian, Chalkokondyles<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>, called it. But his advisers represented
to him the difficult nature of the country which he would have
to traverse, so he prudently desisted from the enterprise. Two years
later, when Mohammed II visited the Morea a second time and finally
destroyed Greek rule in that peninsula, Monemvasia again held out
successfully. After sheltering Demetrios against an attack from his
treacherous brother Thomas, the town gave refuge to the wife and
daughter of the former. Demetrios had, however, promised to give his
daughter in marriage to the great Sultan; and Isa, son of the Pasha of
Üsküb, and Matthew Asan, the Despot’s brother-in-law, were accordingly
sent to demand the surrender of the city and of the two princesses, whom
it contained. The Monemvasiotes did, indeed, hand over the two Imperial
ladies to the envoys of the Sultan and the Despot; but, relying on their
immense natural defences, animated by the sturdy spirit of independence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
which had so long distinguished them, and inspired by the example of
their governor, Manuel Palaiologos, they bade them tell Mohammed not
to lay sacrilegious hands on a city which God had meant to be invincible.
The Sultan is reported to have admired their courage, and wisely
refrained from attacking the impregnable fortress of mediæval Hellenism.
As Demetrios was the prisoner of the Sultan, the Governor proclaimed
Thomas as his liege-lord; but the latter, a fugitive from Greece, was
incapable of maintaining his sovereignty and tried to exchange it with
the Sultan for another sea-side place<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. A passing Catalan corsair, one
Lope de Baldaja, was then invited to occupy the rock; but the liberty-loving
inhabitants soon drove out the petty tyrant whom they had
summoned to their aid, and, with the consent of Thomas, placed their
city under the protection of his patron, the Pope. Pius II gladly
appointed both spiritual and temporal governors of the fortress which
had so long been the stronghold of Orthodoxy, and of that nationalism
with which Orthodoxy was identical<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.</p>

<p>But the papal flag did not wave long over Monemvasia. The Orthodox
Greeks soon grew tired of forming part of the Pope’s temporal dominion,
and preferred the rule of Venice, the strongest maritime power interested
in the Levant, whose governors were well known to be “first Venetians
and then Catholics.” The outbreak of the Turco-Venetian War of 1463,
and the appearance of a Venetian fleet in the Ægean, gave the citizens
their opportunity. The Pope, as Phrantzes informs us, had no wish to
give up the place; but he was far away, his representative was feeble,
the flag of Venice was for the moment triumphant in Greek waters, and
accordingly in 1463 or 1464, the inhabitants admitted a Venetian
garrison. On September 21, 1464, the Senate made provision for the
government of this new dependency. A <i>Podestà</i> was to be elected for
two years at an annual salary of 500 gold ducats, this salary to be paid
every three months out of the revenues of the newly-conquered island
of Lemnos. Six months later, it was decreed that in case there was no
money available for the purpose at Lemnos, the <i>Podestà</i> should receive
his salary from the Cretan treasury<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>. From that time to 1540 Monemvasia
remained a Venetian colony. Once, indeed, a plot was organised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
in the ancient city of the Palaiologoi for the purpose of wresting the
place from the claws of the Lion of St Mark. Andrew Palaiologos, the
still more degenerate son of the degenerate Thomas, had, in 1494,
transferred all his Imperial rights and claims to King Charles VIII of
France, then engaged in his expedition to Naples, in the Church of San
Pietro in Montorio at Rome. In accordance with this futile arrangement
his partisans at Monemvasia, where the Imperial name of Palaiologos
was still popular, schemed to deliver the city to his French ally<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. But
the plans of Charles VIII, and with them the plot at Monemvasia, came
to nought. Venice remained mistress of the Virgin fortress.</p>

</div>

<p>Down to the peace of 1502-3, Monemvasia seems to have been fairly
prosperous under Venetian rule. By the Turco-Venetian treaty of 1479
she had been allowed to retain the dependency of Vatika<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> in the
neighbourhood of Cape Malea, which had been captured from the Turks
in 1463, and where her citizens had long possessed property. But the
territories of Monemvasia were terribly restricted after the next Turco-Venetian
war: she had then lost her outlying castles of Rampano and
Vatika, from which the ecclesiastical authorities derived much of their
dues; and we find the inhabitants petitioning the Republic for the
redress of their grievances, and pointing out that this last delimitation
of their frontiers had deprived them of the lands which they had been
wont to sow. The rock itself produced nothing, and accordingly all their
supplies of corn had now to be imported through the Turkish possessions<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.
As for the famous vintage, which had been the delight of
Western connoisseurs, it was no longer produced at Malvasia, for the
Turks did not cultivate the vineyards which were now in their hands,
and most of the so-called “Malmsey,” <i>nihil de Malfasia habens sed nomen</i>,
as worthy Father Faber says, had for some time come from Crete or
Modon<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>, till the latter place, too, became Turkish. But, in spite of these
losses, Monemvasia still remained what she had been for centuries—an
impregnable fortress, the Gibraltar of Greece. The Venetians renewed
the system, which had prevailed under the Despots of the Morea, of
devoting one of the local imposts to the repair of the walls; the Venetian
<i>Podestà</i>, who lived, like the military governor, up in the castle, seems to
have been a popular official; and the Republic had wisely confirmed the
special privileges granted by the Byzantine Emperors to the Church and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
community of this favoured city (Plate IV). Both a Greek Metropolitan
and a Latin Archbishop continued to take their titles from Monemvasia,
and the most famous of these prelates was the eminent Greek scholar,
Markos Mousouros. It is interesting to note that in 1521 Pope Leo X
had a scheme for founding an academy for the study of the Greek
language out of the revenues of whichever of these sees first fell vacant,
as Arsenios Apostoles, at that time Metropolitan, was a learned Greek
and a Uniate, and in both capacities, a prime favourite of the classically
cultured Pontiff. In 1524, however, despite the thunders of the Œcumenical
Patriarch, the Greek and the Italian prelates agreed among
themselves that the former should retain the see of Monemvasia and
that the latter should take a Cretan diocese<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. The connection between
“the great Greek island” and this rocky peninsula was now close. The
Greek priests of Crete, who had formerly gone to the Venetian colonies
of Modon and Coron for consecration, after the loss of those colonies in
1500 came to Monemvasia; the Cretan exchequer continued to contribute
to the expenses of the latter; and judicial appeals from the <i>Podestà</i> of
Malmsey lay to the colonial authorities at Candia, instead of being
remitted to Venice; for, as a Monemvasiote deputation once plaintively
said, the expenses of the long journey had been defrayed by pawning the
chalices of the churches. Even now Monemvasia is remote from the
world; in those Venetian days she was seldom visited, not only because
of her situation, but because of the fear which ships’ captains had of her
inhabitants<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.</p>

<p>The humiliating peace of 1540, which closed the Turco-Venetian war
of 1537, closed also the history of Venice in the Morea till the brief
revival at the close of the seventeenth century. This shameful treaty
cost the Republic her two last possessions on the mainland of Greece—Nauplia
and Monemvasia, both still uncaptured and the latter scarcely
assailed by the Turkish forces<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. Admiral Mocenigo was sent to break as
best he could to her loyal subjects the sad news that the Republic had
abandoned their homes to the Turks. The Venetian envoy, if we may
believe the speech which Paruta puts into his mouth, repeated to the
weeping people the ancient adage, <i>ubi bene, ibi patria</i>, and pointed out
to them that they would be better off in a new abode less exposed than
their native cities had been to the Turkish peril. In November a Venetian
fleet arrived in the beautiful bay of Nauplia and off the sacred rock of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
Monemvasia to remove the soldiers, the artillery, and all the inhabitants
who wished to live under Venetian rule. Then the banner of the
Evangelist was lowered, the keys of the two last Venetian fortresses in
the Morea were handed to Kassim Pasha, and the receipts for their
transfer were sent to Venice<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure2" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <p class="caption">Fig. 2. <span class="smcap">Arms on Well-Head in the Castle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The inhabitants of the two cities had been loyal to Venice, and Venice
was loyal to them. The first idea of transporting the Monemvasiotes to
the rocky island of Cerigo—then partly a Venetian colony and partly
under the rule of the great Venetian family of Venier, which boasted its
descent from Venus, the fabled goddess of Kythera—was abandoned,
in deference to the eloquent protests of the Metropolitan, and lands were
assigned to the exiles in the more fertile colonies of the Republic. A
commission of five nobles was appointed to consider the claims, and
provide for the settlement, of the <i>stradioti</i>, or light horsemen from
Nauplia and Monemvasia, who had fought like heroes against the Turks;
and this commission sat for several years, for the claimants were numerous
and not all genuine<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. Some, like the ancient local family of Daimonoyannes,
formerly lords of Cerigo, received lands in Crete<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>, where various
members of the Athenian branch of the great Florentine family of the
Medici, which had been settled for two hundred years at Nauplia, also
found a home. Scions of the clan of Mamonas went to Zante and Crete,
and are found later on at Corinth, Nauplia, Athens and Corfù. Others
were removed to Corfù, where they soon formed an integral part of the
Corfiote population and where the name of these <i>stradioti</i> is still
preserved in a locality of the island; while others again were transplanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
to Cephalonia, Cyprus, or Dalmatia. Not a few of them were soon,
however, smitten with home-sickness; they sold their new lands and
returned to be Turkish subjects at Nauplia and Monemvasia<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.</p>

<p>The Venetian fortifications; the old Venetian pictures on the
eikonostasis of the Ἑλκόμενος church; the quaint Italian chimneys,
and the well-head up in the castle, which bears the winged lion of St
Mark, two private coats of arms, the date MDXIV and the initials S R
upon it, the latter those of Sebastiano Renier, <i>Podestà</i> from 1510 to 1512
(to whom the first coat belongs, while the second is that of Antonio
Garzoni, <i>Podestà</i> in 1526 and again in 1538, when he was the last <i>Podestà</i>
before the Turkish conquest), still speak to us of this first Venetian
occupation, when the ancient Byzantine city, after the brief vicissitudes
of French and Papal government, found shelter for nearly eighty years
beneath the flag of the Evangelist (Plate V, Fig. 2 and Text-fig. 2).</p>

<h3 id="heading15">10. THE MARQUISATE OF BOUDONITZA (1204-1414)</h3>

<p>Of all the feudal lordships, founded in Northern Greece at the time
of the Frankish Conquest, the most important and the most enduring
was the Marquisate of Boudonitza. Like the Venieri and the Viari in the
two islands of Cerigo and Cerigotto at the extreme south, the lords of
Boudonitza were Marquesses in the literal sense of the term—wardens
of the Greek Marches—and they maintained their responsible position
on the outskirts of the Duchy of Athens until after the establishment of
the Turks in Thessaly. Apart, too, from its historic importance, the
Marquisate of Boudonitza possesses the romantic glamour which is shed
over a famous classical site by the chivalry of the middle ages. What
stranger accident could there have been than that which made two noble
Italian families the successive guardians of the historic pass which is for
ever associated with the death of Leonidas!</p>

<p>Among the adventurers who accompanied Boniface of Montferrat,
the new King of Salonika, on his march into Greece in the autumn of
1204, was Guido Pallavicini, the youngest son of a nobleman from near
Parma who had gone to the East because at home every common man
could hale him before the courts<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. This was the vigorous personality who,
in the eyes of his conquering chief, seemed peculiarly suited to watch
over the pass of Thermopylæ, whence the Greek <i>archon</i>, Leon Sgouros,
had fled at the mere sight of the Latins in their coats of mail. Accordingly,
he invested him with the fief of Boudonitza, and ere long, on the
Hellenic substructures of Pharygæ, rose the imposing fortress of the
Italian Marquesses.</p>

<p>The site was admirably chosen, and is, indeed, one of the finest in
Greece. The village of Boudonitza, Bodonitza, or Mendenitza, as it is now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
called, lies at a distance of three and a half hours on horseback from the
baths of Thermopylæ and nearly an hour and a half from the top of the
pass which leads across the mountains to Dadi at the foot of Parnassos.
The castle, which is visible for more than an hour as we approach from
Thermopylæ, stands on a hill which bars the valley and occupies a truly
commanding position (Plate VI, Figs. 1 and 2). The Warden of the Marches,
in the Frankish times, could watch from its battlements the blue Maliac
Gulf with the even then important town of Stylida, the landing-place
for Zetounion, or Lamia; his eye could traverse the channel up to, and
beyond, the entrance to the Gulf of Almiro, as the Gulf of Volo was then
called; in the distance he could descry two of the Northern Sporades—Skiathos
and Skopelos—at first in the hands of the friendly Ghisi, then
reconquered by the hostile Byzantine forces. The northernmost of the
three Lombard baronies of Eubœa with the bright streak which marks
the baths of Ædepsos, and the little island of Panaia, or Canaia, between
Eubœa and the mainland, which was one of the last remnants of Italian
rule in this part of Greece, lay outstretched before him; and no pirate
craft could come up the Atalante channel without his knowledge. Landwards,
the view is bounded by vast masses of mountains, but the danger
was not yet from that quarter, while a rocky gorge, the bed of a dry
torrent, isolates one side of the castle. Such was the site where, for
more than two centuries, the Marquesses of Boudonitza watched, as
advanced sentinels, first of “new France” and then of Christendom.</p>

<p>The extent of the Marquisate cannot be exactly defined. In the early
years after the Conquest we find the first Marquess part-owner of Lamia<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>;
his territory extended down to the sea, upon which later on his successors
had considerable commercial transactions, and the harbour from
which they obtained their supplies would seem to have been simply
called the <i>skala</i> of Boudonitza. In 1332 Adam, the Archbishop of
Antivari, alludes to the “castle and port of Boudonice (<i>sic</i>), through
which we shall have in abundance grain of all kinds from Wallachia”
(<i>i.e.</i> Thessaly, the “Great Wallachia” of the Byzantine historians and
of the “Chronicle of the Morea”)<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>. The Pallavicini’s southern frontier
marched with the Athenian <i>seigneurie</i>; but their feudal relations were
not with Athens, but with Achaia. Whether or no we accept the story
of the “Chronicle of the Morea,” that Boniface of Montferrat conferred
the suzerainty of Boudonitza upon Guillaume de Champlitte, or the
more probable story of the elder Sanudo, that the Emperor Baldwin II<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
gave it to Geoffroy II de Villehardouin<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>, it is certain that later on the
Marquess was one of the twelve peers of Achaia<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>, and in 1278 Charles I
of Naples, in his capacity of Prince of Achaia, accordingly notified the
appointment of a bailie of the principality to the Marchioness of that
day<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>. It was only during the Catalan period that the Marquess came to
be reckoned as a feudatory of Athens<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>. Within his dominions was
situated a Roman Catholic episcopal see—that of Thermopylæ,
dependent upon the metropolitan see of Athens. At first the bishop
resided at the town which bore that name; on its destruction, however,
during those troublous times, the bishop and canons built an oratory
at Boudonitza. Even there, however, the pirates penetrated and killed
the bishop, whereupon in 1209 the then occupant of the see, the third
of the series, begged Innocent III to allow him to move to the abbey of
“Communio”—perhaps a monastery founded by one of the Comneni—within
the same district<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>. Towards the close of the fourteenth century,
the bishop was commonly known by the title of “Boudonitza,” because
he resided there, and his see was then one of the four within the confines
of the Athenian Duchy<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Guido, first Marquess of Boudonitza, the “Marchesopoulo,” as his
Greek subjects called him, played a very important part in both the
political and ecclesiastical history of his time—just the part which we
should have expected from a man of his lawless disposition. The
“Chronicle” above quoted represents him as present at the siege of
Corinth. He and his brother, whose name may have been Rubino, were
among the leaders of the Lombard rebellion against the Latin Emperor
Henry in 1209; he obstinately refused to attend the first Parliament of
Ravenika in May of that year; and, leaving his castle undefended, he
retreated with the still recalcitrant rebels behind the stronger walls of
the Kadmeia at Thebes. This incident procured for Boudonitza the
honour of its only Imperial visit; for the Emperor Henry lay there one
evening—a certain Wednesday—on his way to Thebes, and thence rode,
as the present writer has ridden, through the <i>closure</i>, or pass, which leads
over the mountains and down to Dadi and the Bœotian plain—then, as
now, the shortest route from Boudonitza to the Bœotian capital<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
at that time the site of a church of our Lady, <i>Sta Maria de Clusurio</i>, the
property of the abbot and canons of the Lord’s Temple. Like most of
his fellow-nobles, the Marquess was not over-respectful of the rights and
property of the Church to which he belonged. If he granted the strong
position of Lamia to the Templars, he secularised property belonging to
his bishop and displayed a marked unwillingness to pay tithes. We find
him, however, with his fellows, signing the <i>concordat</i> which was drawn up
to regulate the relations between Church and State at the second
Parliament of Ravenika in May, 1210<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.</p>

<p>As one of the leading nobles of the Latin kingdom of Salonika, Guido
continued to be associated with its fortunes. In 1221 we find him acting
as bailie for the Regent Margaret during the minority of the young King
Demetrius, in whose name he ratified a convention with the clergy
respecting the property of the Church<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. His territory became the refuge
of the Catholic Archbishop of Larissa, upon whom the bishopric of
Thermopylæ was temporarily conferred by Honorius III, when the
Greeks of Epeiros drove him from his see. And when the ephemeral
kingdom had fallen before them, the same Pope, in 1224, ordered
Geoffroy II de Villehardouin of Achaia, Othon de la Roche of Athens,
and the three Lombard barons of Eubœa to aid in defending the castle
of Boudonitza, and rejoiced that 1300 <i>hyperperi</i> had been subscribed by
the prelates and clergy for its defence, so that it could be held by “G.
lord of the aforesaid castle,” till the arrival of the Marquess William of
Montferrat<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>. Guido was still living on May 2, 1237, when he made his
will. Soon after that date he probably died; Hopf<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> states in his genealogy,
without citing any authority, that he was killed by the Greeks. He had
survived most of his fellow-Crusaders; and, in consequence of the Greek
reconquest of Thessaly, his Marquisate was now, with the doubtful
exception of Larissa, the northernmost of the Frankish fiefs, the veritable
“March” of Latin Hellas.</p>

<p>Guido had married a Burgundian lady named Sibylle, possibly a
daughter of the house of Cicon, lately established in Greece, and
therefore a cousin of Guy de la Roche of Athens. By her he had two
daughters and a son, Ubertino, who succeeded him as second Marquess.
Despite the feudal tie which should have bound him to the Prince of
Achaia, and which he boldly repudiated, Ubertino assisted his cousin,
the “Great Lord” of Athens, in the fratricidal war between those
prominent Frankish rulers, which culminated in the defeat of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
Athenians at the battle of Karydi in 1258, where the Marquess was
present, and whence he accompanied Guy de la Roche in his retreat to
Thebes. In the following year, however, he obeyed the summons of the
Prince of Achaia to take part in the fatal campaign in aid of the Despot
Michael II of Epeiros against the Greek Emperor of Nice, which ended
on the plain of Pelagonia; and in 1263, when the Prince, after his return
from his Greek prison, made war against the Greeks of the newly
established Byzantine province in the Morea, the Marquess of Boudonitza
was once more summoned to his aid<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>. The revival of Greek power
in Eubœa at this period, and the frequent acts of piracy in the Atalante
channel were of considerable detriment to the people of Boudonitza,
whose food supplies were at times intercepted by the corsairs<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. But the
Marquess Ubertino profited by the will of his sister Mabilia, who had
married Azzo VII d’Este of Ferrara, and bequeathed to her brother in
1264 her property near Parma<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.</p>

<p>After the death of Ubertino, the Marquisate, like so many Frankish
baronies, fell into the hands of a woman. The new Marchioness of
Boudonitza was his second sister, Isabella, who is included in the above-mentioned
circular note, addressed to all the great magnates of Achaia
by Charles I of Anjou, the new Prince, and notifying to them the
appointment of Galeran d’Ivry as the Angevin vicar-general in the
principality. On that occasion, the absence of the Marchioness was one
of the reasons alleged by Archbishop Benedict of Patras, in the name of
those present at Glarentza, for the refusal of homage to the new bailie<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.
So important was the position of the Marquisate as one of the twelve
peerages of Achaia.</p>

<p>The Marchioness Isabella died without children; and, accordingly,
in 1286, a disputed succession arose between her husband, a Frank
settled in the East, and the nearest male representative of the Pallavicini
family, her cousin Tommaso, grandson of the first Marquess’s
brother, Rubino. The dispute was referred to Guillaume de la Roche,
Duke of Athens, in his capacity of bailie of Achaia, before the feudal
court of which a question relating to Boudonitza would legally come.
Tommaso, however, settled the matter by seizing the castle, and not
only maintained himself there, but transmitted the Marquisate to his
son, Alberto<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>The fifth Marquess is mentioned as among those summoned by
Philip of Savoy, Prince of Achaia, to the famous Parliament and
tournament on the Isthmus of Corinth in the spring of 1305, and as
having been one of the magnates who obeyed the call of Philip’s namesake
and successor, Philip of Taranto, in 1307<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>. Four years later he fell,
at the great battle of the Kephissos, fighting against the Catalans
beneath the lion banner of Walter of Brienne<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>, who by his will a few
days before had bequeathed 100 <i>hyperperi</i> to the church of Boudonitza<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>.</p>

<p>The Marquisate, alone of the Frankish territories north of the
Isthmus, escaped conquest by the Catalans, though, as at Athens, a
widow and her child were alone left to defend it. Alberto had married
a rich Eubœan heiress, Maria dalle Carceri, a scion of the Lombard
family which had come from Verona at the time of the Conquest. By
this marriage he had become a hexarch, or owner of one-sixth of that
great island, and is so officially described in the Venetian list of Greek
rulers. Upon his death, in accordance with the rules of succession laid
down in the <i>Book of the Customs of the Empire of Romania</i>, the Marquisate
was divided in equal shares between his widow and his infant
daughter, Guglielma. Maria did not, however, long remain unconsoled;
indeed, political considerations counselled an immediate marriage with
some one powerful enough to protect her own and her child’s interests
from the Catalans of Athens. Hitherto the Wardens of the Northern
March had only needed to think of the Greek enemies in front, for all
the territory behind them, where Boudonitza was most easily assailable,
had been in the hands of Frenchmen and friends. More fortunate than
most of the high-born dames of Frankish Greece, the widowed
Marchioness had avoided the fate of accepting one of her husband’s
conquerors as his successor. Being thus free to choose, she selected as
her spouse Andrea Cornaro, a Venetian of good family, a great personage
in Crete, and Baron of Skarpanto. Cornaro thus, in 1312, received, by
virtue of his marriage, his wife’s moiety of Boudonitza<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>, while her
daughter conferred the remaining half, by her subsequent union with
Bartolommeo Zaccaria, upon a member of that famous Genoese race,
which already owned Chios and was about to establish a dynasty in the
Morea<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>.</p>

<p>Cornaro now came to reside in Eubœa, where self-interest as well as
patriotism led him to oppose the claims of Alfonso Fadrique, the new
viceroy of the Catalan Duchy of Athens. His opposition and the natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
ambition of Fadrique brought down, however, upon the Marquisate the
horrors of a Catalan invasion, and it was perhaps on this occasion that
Bartolommeo Zaccaria was carried off as a captive and sent to a Sicilian
prison, whence he was only released at the intervention of Pope John
XXII. It was fortunate for the inhabitants of Boudonitza that Venice
included Cornaro in the truce which she made with the Catalans in
1319<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>. Four years later he followed his wife to the grave, and her
daughter was thenceforth sole Marchioness.</p>

<p>Guglielma Pallavicini was a true descendant of the first Marquess.
Of all the rulers of Boudonitza, with his exception, she was the most self-willed,
and she might be included in that by no means small number of
strong-minded, unscrupulous, and passionate women, whom Frankish
Greece produced and whom classic Greece might have envied as subjects
for her tragic stage. On the death of her Genoese husband, she considered
that both the proximity of Boudonitza to the Venetian colony of
Negroponte and her long-standing claims to the castle of Larmena in
that island required that she should marry a Venetian, especially as the
decision of her claim and even her right to reside in the island depended
upon the Venetian bailie. Accordingly, she begged the Republic to give
her one of its nobles as her consort, and promised dutifully to accept
whomsoever the Senate might choose. The choice fell upon Nicolò
Giorgio, or Zorzi, to give him the Venetian form of the name, who belonged
to a distinguished family which had given a Doge to the Republic
and had recently assisted young Walter of Brienne in his abortive
campaign to recover his father’s lost duchy from the Catalans. A
Venetian galley escorted him in 1335 to the haven of Boudonitza, and
a Marquess, the founder of a new line, once more ruled over the castle
of the Pallavicini<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>.</p>

<p>At first there was no cause to regret the alliance. If the Catalans,
now established at Neopatras and Lamia, within a few hours of
Boudonitza, occupied several villages of the adjacent Marquisate, despite
the recommendations of Venice, Nicolò I came to terms with them,
probably by agreeing to pay that annual tribute of four fully equipped
horses to the Vicar-General of the Duchy of Athens, which we find
constituting the feudal bond between that state and Boudonitza in the
time of his son<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>. He espoused, too, the Eubœan claims of his wife; but
Venice, which had an eye upon the strong castle of Larmena, diplomatically
referred the legal question to the bailie of Achaia, of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
both Eubœa and Boudonitza were technically still reckoned as dependencies.
The bailie, in the name of the suzeraine Princess of Achaia,
Catherine of Valois, decided against Guglielma, and the purchase of
Larmena by Venice ended her hopes. Furious at her disappointment,
the Marchioness accused her Venetian husband of cowardice and of bias
towards his native city, while more domestic reasons increased her
indignation. Her consort was a widower, while she had had a daughter
by her first marriage, and she suspected him of favouring his own
offspring at the expense of her child, Marulla, in whose name she had
deposited a large sum of money at the Venetian bank in Negroponte.
To complete the family tragedy played within the walls of Boudonitza
there was only now lacking a sinister ally of the angry wife. He, too,
was forthcoming in the person of Manfredo Pallavicini, the relative,
business adviser, and perhaps paramour, of the Marchioness. As one of
the old conqueror’s stock, he doubtless regarded the Venetian husband
as an interloper who had first obtained the family honours and then
betrayed his trust. At last a crisis arrived. Pallavicini insulted the
Marquess, his feudal superior; the latter threw him into prison, whereupon
the prisoner attempted the life of his lord. As a peer of Achaia, the
Marquess enjoyed the right of inflicting capital punishment. He now
exercised it; Pallavicini was executed, and the assembled burgesses of
Boudonitza, if we may believe the Venetian version, approved the act,
saying that it was better that a vassal should die rather than inflict an
injury on his lord.</p>

<p>The sequel showed, however, that Guglielma was not appeased. She
might have given assent with her lips to what the burgesses had said.
But she worked upon their feelings of devotion to her family, which had
ruled so long over them; they rose against the foreign Marquess at their
Lady’s instigation; and Nicolò was forced to flee across to Negroponte,
leaving his little son Francesco and all his property behind him. Thence
he proceeded to Venice, and laid his case before the Senate. That body
warmly espoused his cause, and ordered the Marchioness to receive him
back to his former honourable position, or to deliver up his property. In
the event of her refusal, the bailie of Negroponte was instructed to break
off all communications between Boudonitza and that island and to
sequestrate her daughter’s money still lying in the Eubœan bank. In
order to isolate her still further, letters were to be sent to the Catalans
of Athens, requesting them not to interfere between husband and wife.
As the Marchioness remained obdurate, Venice made a last effort for an
amicable settlement, begging the Catalan leaders, Queen Joanna I of
Naples, as the head of the house of Anjou, to which the principality of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
Achaia belonged, and the Dauphin Humbert II of Vienne, then
commanding the papal fleet against the Turks, to use their influence on
behalf of her citizen. When this failed, the bailie carried out his instructions,
confiscated the funds deposited in the bank, and paid Nicolò
out of them the value of his property. Neither the loss of her daughter’s
money nor the spiritual weapons of Pope Clement VI could move the
obstinate Lady of Boudonitza, and in her local bishop, Nitardus of
Thermopylæ, she could easily find an adviser who dissuaded her from
forgiveness<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. So Nicolò never returned to Boudonitza; he served the
Republic as envoy to the Serbian Tsar, Dushan, and as one of the Doge’s
Councillors, and died at Venice in 1354. After his death, the Marchioness
at once admitted their only son, Francesco, the “Marchesotto,” as he
was called, now a youth of seventeen, to rule with her, and, as the
Catalans were once more threatening her land, made overtures to the
Republic. The latter, glad to know that a Venetian citizen was once
more ruling as Marquess at Boudonitza, included him and his mother in
its treaties with Athens, and when Guglielma died, in 1358, after a long
and varied career, her son received back the confiscated property of his
late half-sister<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.</p>

<p>The peaceful reign of Francesco was a great contrast to the stormy
career of his mother. His Catalan neighbours, divided by the jealousies
of rival chiefs, had no longer the energy for fresh conquests. The establishment
of a Serbian kingdom in Thessaly only affected the Marquess
in so far as it enabled him to bestow his daughter’s hand upon a Serbian
princelet<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>. The Turkish peril, which was destined to swallow up the
Marquisate in the next generation, was, however, already threatening
Catalans, Serbs, and Italians alike, and accordingly Francesco Giorgio
was one of the magnates of Greece whom Pope Gregory XI invited to
the Congress on the Eastern question, which was summoned to meet at
Thebes<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> on October 1, 1373. But when the Athenian duchy, of which he
was a tributary, was distracted by a disputed succession between Maria,
Queen of Sicily, and Pedro IV of Aragon, the Venetian Marquess, chafing
at his vassalage and thinking that the moment was favourable for
severing his connexion with the Catalans, declared for the Queen. He
was, in fact, the most important member of the minority which was in
her favour, for we are told that “he had a very fine estate,” and we know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
that he had enriched himself by mercantile ventures. Accordingly he
assisted the Navarrese Company in its attack upon the duchy, so that
Pedro IV wrote in 1381 to the Venetian bailie of Negroponte, begging
him to prevent his fellow-countryman at Boudonitza from helping the
King’s enemies. As the Marquess had property in the island, he had
given hostages to fortune. The victory of the Aragonese party closed the
incident, and the generous policy of the victors was doubtless extended
to him. But in 1388 the final overthrow of the Catalan rule by Nerio
Acciajuoli made the Marquisate independent of the Duchy of Athens<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.
In feudal lists—such as that of 1391—the Marquess continued to figure
as one of the temporal peers of Achaia<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>, but his real position was that of
a “citizen and friend” of Venice, to whom he now looked for help in
trouble.</p>

<p>Francesco may have lived to see this realisation of his hopes, for he
seems to have died about 1388, leaving the Marquisate to his elder son,
Giacomo, under the regency of his widow Euphrosyne, a daughter of the
famous insular family of Sommaripa, which still survives in the Cyclades<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>.
But the young Marquess soon found that he had only exchanged his
tribute to the Catalan Vicar-General for a tribute to the Sultan. We are
not told the exact moment at which Bayezid I imposed this payment,
but there can be little doubt that Boudonitza first became tributary to
the Turks in the campaign of 1393-4, when “the Thunderbolt” fell
upon Northern Greece, when the Marquess’s Serbian brother-in-law was
driven from Pharsala and Domoko, when Lamia and Neopatras were
surrendered, when the county of Salona, founded at the same time as
Boudonitza, ceased to exist. On the way to Salona, the Sultan’s army
must have passed within four hours of Boudonitza, and we surmise that
it was spared, either because the season was so late—Salona fell in
February, 1394—or because the castle was so strong, or because its lord
was a Venetian. This respite was prolonged by the fall of Bayezid at
Angora and the fratricidal struggle between his sons, while the Marquess
was careful to have himself included in the treaties of 1403, 1408, and
1409 between the Sultan Suleyman and Venice; a special clause in the
first of these instruments released him from all obligations except that
which he had incurred towards the Sultan’s father Bayezid<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>. Still, even
in Suleyman’s time, such was his sense of insecurity, that he obtained
leave from Venice to send his peasants and cattle over to the strong
castle of Karystos in Eubœa, of which his brother Nicolò had become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
the lessee<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>. He figured, too, in the treaty of 1405, which the Republic
concluded with Antonio I Acciajuoli, the new ruler of Athens, and might
thus consider himself as safe from attack on the south<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>. Indeed, he was
anxious to enlarge his responsibilities, for he was one of those who bid
for the two Venetian islands of Tenos and Mykonos, when they were put
up to auction in the following year. In this offer, however, he failed<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.</p>

<p>The death of Suleyman and the accession of his brother Musa in 1410
sealed the fate of the Marquess. Early in the spring a very large Turkish
army appeared before the old castle. Boudonitza was strong, and its
Marquess a resolute man, so that for a long time the siege was in vain.
“Giacomo,” says the Venetian document composed by his son, “preferred,
like the high-minded and true Christian that he was, to die rather than
surrender the place.” But there was treachery within the castle walls;
betrayed by one of his servants, the Marquess fell, like another Leonidas,
bravely defending the mediæval Thermopylæ against the new Persian
invasion. Even then, his sons, “following in their father’s footsteps,”
held the castle some time longer in the hope that Venice would remember
her distant children in their distress. The Senate did, indeed, order the
Captain of the Gulf to make inquiries whether Boudonitza still resisted
and in that case to send succour to its gallant defenders—the cautious
Government added—“with as little expense as possible.” But before
the watchmen on the keep could descry the Captain sailing up the
Atalante channel, all was over; both food and ammunition had given out
and the Zorzi were constrained to surrender, on condition that their lives
and property were spared. The Turks broke their promises, deprived their
prisoners of their goods, expelled them from the home of their ancestors,
and dragged young Nicolò to the Sultan’s Court at Adrianople<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.</p>

<p>Considerable confusion prevails in this last act of the history of
Boudonitza, owing to the fact that the two leading personages, the
brother and eldest son of the late Marquess, bore the same name of
Nicolò. Hopf has accordingly adopted two different versions in his
three accounts of these events. On a review of the documentary evidence,
it would seem that the brother, the Baron of Karystos, was not at
Boudonitza during the siege, and that, on the capture of his nephew, he
proclaimed himself Marquess. Venice recognised his title, and instructed
her envoy to Musa to include him in her treaty with the Sultan and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
procure at the same time the release of the late Marquess’s son. Accordingly,
in the peace of 1411, Musa promised, for love of Venice and seeing
that he passed as a Venetian, to harass him no more, on condition that
he paid the tribute established. Not only so, but the Marquess’s ships
and merchandise were allowed to enter the Turkish dominions on payment
of a fixed duty<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. Thus temporarily restored, the Marquisate
remained in the possession of the uncle, from whom the nephew, even
after his release, either could not, or cared not to claim it. He withdrew
to Venice, and, many years later, received as the reward of his father’s
heroic defence of Boudonitza, the post of <i>châtelain</i> of Pteleon, near the
mouth of the Gulf of Volo, the last Venetian outpost on the mainland of
North-Eastern Greece—a position which he held for eight years<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his uncle, the Marquess, had lost all but his barren title.
Though the Turks had evacuated Boudonitza, and the castle had been
repaired, he felt so insecure that he sent his bishop as an emissary to
Venice, begging for aid in the event of a fresh Turkish invasion and for
permission to transport back to Boudonitza the serfs whom he had sent
across to Karystos a few years before<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>. His fears proved to be well
founded. In vain the Republic gave orders that he should be included
in her treaty with the new Sultan, Mohammed I. On June 20, 1414, a
large Turkish army attacked and took the castle, and with it many
prisoners, the Marquess, so it would seem, among them—for in the
following year we find his wife, an adopted daughter of the Duke of
Athens, appealing to Venice to obtain his release from his Turkish
dungeon<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. He recovered his freedom, but not his Marquisate. In the
treaty of 1416, Boudonitza was, indeed, actually assigned to him in
return for the usual tribute; but nine years later we find Venice still
vainly endeavouring to obtain its restitution<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. He continued, however,
to hold the title of Marquess of Boudonitza with the castle of Karystos,
which descended to his son, the “Marchesotto,” and his son’s son<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>, till
the Turkish conquest of Eubœa in 1470 put an end to Venetian rule over
that great island. Thence the last titular Marquess of Boudonitza, after
governing Lepanto, retired to Venice, whence the Zorzi came and where
they are still largely represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>Of the castle, where for two hundred years Pallavicini and Zorzi held
sway, much has survived the two Turkish sieges and the silent ravages
of five centuries. Originally there must have been a triple enclosure, for
several square towers of the third and lowest wall are still standing in
the village and outside it. Of the second enceinte the most noticeable
fragment is a large tower in ruins, while the innermost wall is strengthened
by three more. In the centre of this last enclosure are the imposing
remains of the large square donjon (Plate VII, Fig. 1), and adjoining this
is the most interesting feature of the castle—the great Hellenic gateway
(Plate VII, Fig. 2), which connects one portion of this enclosure with the
other, and which Buchon has described so inaccurately<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. It is <i>not</i> “composed
of six stones,” but of three huge blocks, nor do “the two upper
stones meet at an acute angle”; a single horizontal block forms the top.
Buchon omits to mention the Byzantine decoration in brick above this
gateway. Of the brick conduit which he mentions I could find no trace,
but the two cisterns remain. The large building near them is presumably
the Frankish church of which he speaks; but the window which he found
there no longer exists. Possibly, when the new church in the village was
erected, the builders took materials from the chapel in the castle for its
construction. At any rate, that very modern and commonplace edifice
contains several fragments of ancient work. Thus, the stone threshold of
the west door bears three large roses, while on the doorway itself are two
stars; and the north door is profusely decorated with a rose, two curious
creatures like griffins, two circles containing triangles, and a leaf; above
this door is a cross, each arm of which forms a smaller cross. As usually
happens in the Frankish castles of Greece—with the exception of Geraki—there
are no coats of arms at Boudonitza, unless this composite cross
is an allusion to the “three crosses,” said to have been originally borne
by one branch of the Pallavicini. The “mediæval seal” in the possession
of a local family dates from the reign of Otho! But there exists a genuine
seal of the monastery of the Holy Virgin of Boudonitza, ascribed by
M. Schlumberger<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> to the end of the fourteenth or beginning of the
fifteenth century. The Marquesses have left behind them neither their
portraits—like the Palatine Counts of Cephalonia of the second dynasty—nor
any coins—like the French barons of Salona, to whom they bear
the nearest resemblance. One of their line, however, the Marquess
Alberto, figures in K. Rhanghaves’s play, <i>The Duchess of Athens</i>, and
their castle and their ofttimes stormy lives fill not the least picturesque
page of that romance which French and Italian adventurers wrote with
their swords in the classic sites of Hellas.</p>

Nicolay pro ambaxatore, exponendo eidem, quomodo iam diu ipsam ad
dominacionem misit suos procuratores et ambaxatores petens sibi per
dominacionem de uno nobilium suorum pro marito provideri, et volens
dominacio suis beneplacitis complacere, consensit quod ipse dominus Nicolaus
carus civis suus ad eam iret, quem ipsa domina receptando, ostendit id
habere multum ad bonum. Et quoniam ob hoc semper Ducale Dominium
promtum et favorabilem se exhibuit ad omnia que suam et suorum securitatem
respicerent et augumentum, treuguas quamplurimas confirmando et
opportuna alia faciendo. Sed cum nuperrime per relacionem ipsius domini
Nicolay viri sui ad ducalis magnificentie audienciam sit deductus de morte
cuiusdam Pallavesini inopinatus casus occursus qui mortuus fuit in culpa
sua, sicut postmodum extitit manifestum, quia dum ipse Marchio coram
omnibus burgensibus congregatis, de velle et consensu dicte domine exponeret
rei geste seriem, ab ipsis habuit in responsum quod ipse Palavesin
dignam penam luerat propter foliam suam, et melius erat, quod ipse, qui
vaxallus erat mortuus fuisset quam dicto suo domino iniuriam aliquam
intulisset, quod ecciam ipsa domina in presencia dictorum burgensium
ratificavit. Unde consideratis predictis vellit amore dominij, ipsum
dominum Nicolaum honori pristino restituere, quod si fecerit, quamquam
sit iustum et honestum nobis plurimum complacebit, et erimus suis comodis
stricius obligati. Verum si dicta domina dubitaret de recipiendo ipsum dicat
et exponat ambaxator prefatus, quod firmiter dominacio hanc rem super se
assumpsit et taliter imposuit civi suo quod minime poterit dubitare. Que
omnia si dicta domina acetabit bene quidem, si vero non contentaretur et
ipsum recipere non vellet, procuret habere et obtinere omnia bona dicti
Marchionis que secum scripta portet antedictus ambaxator et si ipsa ea bona

tantam iniuriam, quam dominacio suam propriam reputat, non poterit
sustinere, sed providebit de remediis opportunis sicuti honori suo et
indenitati sui civis viderit convenire, firmiter tenens quod sicut semper
dominacio ad sui conservacionem et suorum exhibuit se promtam favorabilem
et benignam, sic in omnibus reperiet ipsam mutatam, agravando
factum cum hijs et alijs verbis, ut viderit convenire. Et rediens Nigropontum

<h3 id="heading16">11. ITHAKE UNDER THE FRANKS</h3>

<p>In works descriptive of Greece it is customary to find the statement
that the island of Odysseus was “completely forgotten in the middle
ages,” and even so learned a mediæval scholar as the late Antonios
Meliarakes, whose loss is a severe blow to Greek historical geography,
asserts this proposition in his admirable political and geographical work
on the prefecture of Cephalonia<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. But there are a considerable number
of allusions to Ithake during the Frankish period, and it is possible, at
least in outline, to make out the fortunes of the famous island under its
western lords.</p>

<p>The usual name for Ithake in Italian documents is Val di Compare,
the earliest use of which, so far as I can ascertain, occurs in the Genoese
historian Caffaro’s <i>Liberatio Orientis</i>, written in the first half of the
twelfth century<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. According to K. Bergotes of Cephalonia this name was
given to the island by an Italian captain, who was driven to anchor there
one stormy night. Seeing a light shining through the darkness, he landed,
and found that it proceeded from a hut in which a child had lately been
born. At the request of the parents he accepted the office of godfather,
or κουμπάρος at the child’s christening, and named the valley where the
hut lay Val di Compare, to commemorate the event. Whether this
derivation be correct or not, the name stuck to the island for several
centuries, though we shall also find the classical Ithake still surviving
contemporaneously with it. The neighbouring islands of Zante and
Cephalonia were severed from the Byzantine empire in 1185, at the time
of the invasion of Greece by the Normans of Sicily, and were occupied
by their admiral, Margaritone of Brindisi. Ithake is not specially
mentioned as included among his conquests, but its connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
other two islands under the rule of his immediate successors makes it
very probable. Six years later, in the graphic account of Greece as it was
in 1191, ascribed to Benedict of Peterborough, Fale (Valle) de Compar
is said to have had a specially evil reputation for piracy, and the channel
between it and Cephalonia is described as a favourite lair of those
robbers<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>. After Margaritone’s death he was succeeded by a Count Maio,
or Matthew, a member of the great Roman family of Orsini, who seems
to have been born in Apulia—according to one account he came from
Monopoli—and who at the time of the fourth crusade was lord of
Cephalonia, Zante, and <i>Theachi, el qual se clamado agora Val de Compare</i><a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>,
under the suzerainty of the king of Sicily. Although the two larger of
those islands had fallen to the share of Venice by the partition treaty he
and his descendants continued in possession of them and of Ithake,
though he thought it wise, in 1209, to acknowledge the overlordship of
the Republic. A Venetian document of 1320, alluding to this transaction,
specially mentions Val di Compare as one of the islands, for which he
then did homage<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>. In 1236 the count recognised as his suzerain Prince
Geoffroy II of Achaia, and he and his successors were henceforth
reckoned among the twelve peers of that principality, in whose history
they played an important part<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.</p>

<p>The next mention of Ithake occurs in a Greek document of 1264,
in which Count Matthew’s son and successor, “the most high and
mighty Richard, palatine count and lord of Cephalonia, Zakynthos, and
Ithake,” confirms the possessions of the Latin bishopric of Cephalonia<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.
Here Ithake is called by its classical name, which was not confined
to Greeks, for we find it used in a Venetian document of 1278,
where the island is again mentioned as the scene of piracies<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>. Later on,
in 1294, a document in the Angevin archives at Naples mentions the
promise of Count Richard to bestow “the castle of Koronos”—a name
still given to part of the island of Cephalonia—“or the island of Ithake”
(<i>sive vellent castrum Corony de dominio suo, sive vellent insulam Ythace</i>)
upon his son John I, on the occasion of the latter’s marriage with the
daughter of Nikephoros I, despot of Epeiros<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>. Richard, in spite of the
repeated remonstrances of Charles II of Naples, who, in virtue of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
treaty of Viterbo, was suzerain of Achaia, and accordingly of Cephalonia,
failed to carry out this promise. We next hear of Val di Compare in the
above-mentioned Venetian document of 1320, in which Count John I’s
son, Nicholas, who had two years earlier murdered his nephew, the last
Despot of Epeiros of the house of the Angeloi, and had made himself
Despot, is reminded that his ancestor Matthew had done homage, as he
was now offering to do, for the three islands of Cephalonia, Zante, and
Val di Compare to the Venetian republic.</p>

<p>Although not mentioned by name Ithake doubtless followed the
fortunes of Cephalonia and Zante when those islands were conquered
from the Orsini by John of Gravina, prince of Achaia, in 1324. The
“county of Cephalonia,” of which the island of Odysseus had long
formed a part, was thus under the direct authority of the Angevins,
and was transferred by John of Gravina, together with the principality
of Achaia, to Robert of Taranto in 1333, after which date the same
Angevin officials held office in both Achaia and the insular county till
Robert bestowed the latter in 1357 upon his friend Leonardo Tocco,
a Neapolitan courtier, whose family came from Benevento. In an
ecclesiastical document<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> of 1389 the Greek bishop of Methone, writing
about the archbishopric of Levkas, mentions “the duchess Franka
(Francesca), lady of Levkas, Ithake, Zante and Cephalonia,” the allusion
being to the daughter of Nerio I Acciajuoli of Athens, who had in the
previous year married Carlo I Tocco, count of Cephalonia and duke of
Levkadia. A little earlier, in a Piedmontese document<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> of 1387, we find
Amedeo of Savoy, one of the claimants to the principality of Achaia,
rewarding the zeal of one of his Greek supporters, Joannes Laskaris
Kalopheros, with Cephalonia, Zante, Val di Compare, and other places
as hereditary possessions—a gift which was, of course, never carried out,
as the islands were not Amedeo’s to bestow. Spandugino<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> specially
mentions “Itaca,” or “Val di Compare,” as being part of the insular
dominions of the Tocchi, and Carlo II Tocco is described in documents
of 1430 and 1433, and by the annalist Stefano Magno, as <i>comes palatinus
Cephaloniæ, Ithacæ, et Jacinti</i>—a designation repeated in a document of
1458 after his death<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. We find an allusion to it under both its classical
and its mediæval name in the <i>Liber Insularum</i> of Buondelmonti<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>,
written in 1422, and the latter also occurs in a Venetian document of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
1430, where Val di Compare<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> is stated to belong to Carlo II. Six years
later the archæologist Cyriacus of Ancona, visiting the “king of the
Epeirotes,” as he calls that prince, mentions <i>Itaci</i> (sic) <i>insulæ</i> as opposite
the mainland<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>. After Leonardo III lost practically all his continental
possessions to the Turks in 1449 he still retained the islands, Ithake
among them, under the protection of Venice, of which both he and his
father were honorary citizens, and under the nominal suzerainty of the
kings of Naples. From a document of 1558 we learn that it was in his
time that the family of Galates—the only Ithakan family which enjoyed
the privileges of nobility in the Venetian period, and which is still extant
in the island—first received exemptions<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>. It was he too who revived
the Orthodox see of Cephalonia and bestowed it, together with spiritual
jurisdiction over Ithake, upon Gerasimos Loverdo<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.</p>

<p>When Mohammed II sent Achmet Pasha to conquer all that remained
of Leonardo’s dominions in 1479 we are told by Stefano Magno<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> that the
Turkish commander “ravaged also the island of Itacha (<i>sic</i>), called Valle
di Compare, which belonged to the said lord,” whom he also styles
“palatine count of Cephalonia, Itaca (<i>sic</i>) and Zakynthos.” Loredano,
the Venetian admiral, thereupon sent some galleys to Ithake and rescued
seven or eight persons—an act of which the pasha complained. This
devastation of the island will account for the fact that, in 1504, the
Venetian government, which then owned Cephalonia and Zante, took
steps for repopulating “an island named Val di Compare, situated
opposite Cephalonia, at present uninhabited, but reported to have been
formerly fertile and fruitful.” Accordingly lands were offered to settlers,
free from all taxes for five years, at the end of which time the colonists
were to pay to the Treasury of Cephalonia the same dues as the inhabitants
of that island<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>. Thenceforth down to 1797 Ithake remained
beneath the sway of the Venetian republic. The offer of the senate seems
to have been successful; among those who accepted it were the family
of Boua Grivas, of Albanian origin, connected with the clan of Boua,
which had formerly ruled over Arta and Lepanto and had played a part
in the Albanian revolts of 1454 and 1463 in the Morea, that of Petalas,
and that of Karavias, which in modern times produced a local historian
of Ithake<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>. In 1548 Antonio Calbo, the retiring <i>provveditore</i> of Cephalonia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
reported to the Venetian government, that “under the jurisdiction of
Cephalonia there is another island, named Thiachi, very mountainous
and barren, in which there are different harbours and especially a
harbour called Vathi; in the island of Thiachi are three hamlets, in three
places, inhabited by about sixty families, who are in great fear of
corsairs, because they have no fortress in which to take refuge<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>.” The
three hamlets mentioned in this report are doubtless those of Paleochora,
Anoe, and Exoe, which are regarded as the oldest in the
island.</p>

<p>The former counts of Ithake were till lately the only Latin rulers
of Greece who still existed in prosperous circumstances. But in the
seventeenth century they took the title of “prince of Achaia”—to
which they were not entitled, although the counts of Cephalonia had
once been peers of Achaia and Leonardo II and Carlo I had for a short
time occupied Glarentza. The modern representative of the family was
Carlo, Duke of Regina<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, who succeeded his cousin Francesco Tocco in
1894. But he is now dead and his only son was killed in a motor
accident.</p>

<h3 id="heading17">12. THE LAST VENETIAN ISLANDS IN THE ÆGEAN</h3>

<p>It has hitherto been asserted by historians of the Latin Orient
that, after the capture of the Cyclades by the Turks in the sixteenth
century, the two Venetian islands of Tenos and Mykonos remained in
the possession of the Republic down to 1715. As to Tenos, this statement
is unimpeachable; as to Mykonos, despite the assertions of Hopf<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and
Hertzberg<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>, who quote no authorities for the fact, all the evidence goes
to show that it ceased to belong to Venice in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The two islands, the only members of the Cyclades group under the
direct rule of the Venetian government, were bequeathed to the Republic
by George III Ghisi, their ancestral lord, upon whose death in 1390 they
passed into its hands. The islanders implored Venice not to dispose of
them; and, though there were not failing applicants for them among the
Venetian princelets of the Levant, she listened to the petition of the
inhabitants. At first an official from Negroponte was sent as an annual
governor; then, in 1407, Venetian nobles who would accept the governorship
of Tenos and Mykonos, with which <i>Le Sdiles</i>, or Delos, was joined,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
for a term of four years, paying a certain sum out of the revenues to
Venice and keeping the balance for themselves, were invited to send in
their names. One of them was appointed, still under the authority of
the bailie of Negroponte<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>; and this system continued down to 1430,
when a rector was sent out from Venice for two years, and the two
islands were thenceforth governed directly by an official of the Republic.</p>

<p>Mykonos remained united with Tenos under the flag of St Mark till
the first great raid of the Turkish fleet in the Cyclades under Khaireddîn
Barbarossa in 1537. Neither Andrea Morosini nor Paruta, nor yet Hajji
Kalifeh, mentions its fate in their accounts of that fatal cruise; but
Andrea Cornaro in his <i>Historia di Candia</i><a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> relates that, after taking the
two islands of Thermia and Zia, Barbarossa went to Mykonos, many of
whose inhabitants escaped to Tenos, while the others became his
captives. After the Turkish admiral’s departure the fugitives returned;
but in the same year one of Barbarossa’s lieutenants, a corsair named
Granvali, with eighteen ships, paid a second visit to Mykonos and carried
off many of them. Accordingly the shameful treaty<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> between Venice
and the Sultan, concluded in 1540, in both versions mentions Mykonos
among the islands ceded to the Sultan, while Tenos was expressly
retained. How, in the face of this, Hopf can have asserted that Mykonos
still remained Venetian it is difficult to understand. Nor is this all. In
a document of 1545 the Republic orders her ambassador at Constantinople
to obtain the restoration of the island<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>; in 1548 a certain Zuan Zorzo
Muazzo, of Tenos, begs, and receives, from the Venetian government
another fief in compensation for that which he had lost in Mykonos<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>. A
petition from the inhabitants of Tenos to Venice in 1550 mentions the
lack of ships “at the present time when Mykonos has been lost<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>.” We
have, too, the statement of Sauger<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>, who becomes more trustworthy as
he approaches his own time, that Duke Giovanni IV Crispo, of Naxos,
bestowed the island of Mykonos (apparently in 1541) upon his daughter
on her marriage with Giovanfrancesco Sommaripa, lord of Andros. There
is nothing improbable in this. The Turks acquiesced at the same time
in the action of the duke in turning the Premarini family out of their
part of Zia, and bestowing that also upon his son-in-law; they may have
had no objection to his dealing in the same manner with the devastated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
island of Mykonos. At any rate the latter was no longer Venetian. The
long and elaborate reports<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> of the Venetian commissioners, who visited
Tenos in 1563 and 1584, make no mention whatever of Mykonos, except
that in the latter document we hear of a Grimani as Catholic bishop of
Tenos and of the sister island; nor does Foscarini allude to it in his report
on Cerigo and Tenos in 1577. More conclusive still, while the style of the
Venetian governor is “rector of Tenos and Mykonos” down to 1593,
from that date onwards the governor is officially described as “rector of
Tenos” alone<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>. Hopf<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> is, therefore, wrong in giving us a long list of
<i>rettori di Tinos e Myconos</i> from 1407 to 1717. It seems probable that
the latter island ceased to belong to Venice in 1537, but that the rector
of Tenos continued to bear the name of Mykonos also, as a mere form,
for rather more than half a century longer. Possibly it may have
belonged to the Sommaripa of Andros from 1541 to 1566, when that
dynasty was dethroned.</p>

<p>These conclusions are confirmed by the travellers and geographers
who wrote about the Levant between that date and the loss of Tenos.
Porcacchi<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>, in 1572, mentions Mykonos, without saying to whom it
belonged. One of the Argyroi, barons of Santorin, who, in 1581, gave
Crusius the information about the Cyclades which he embodied in his
<i>Turco-Græcia</i><a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>, had nothing to say about Mykonos, except that it
contained one castle and some hamlets, while he specially mentioned
that Tenos and Cerigo were “under Venice.” Botero<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>, in 1605, giving
a full list of the Venetian possessions in the Levant, includes the Ionian
Islands and Tenos alone. Neither the French ambassador, Louis des
Hayes<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>, who visited Greece in 1630, nor the sieur du Loir<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>, who sailed
with him, is more explicit, though both describe Crete, Cerigo, and
Tenos as the sole Venetian islands in the Ægean. Thévenot<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>, in 1656,
and Boschini<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>, ten years later, tell us that Mykonos was “almost
depopulated” because of corsairs, but are likewise silent as to its
ownership. Baudrand, in his <i>Geographia</i><a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>, remarked, however, that it
had been <i>sub dominio Turcarum à sæculo et ultra, cum antea Venetis
pareret</i>, an account which appears to me to coincide with the real facts.
But both Spon<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and Wheler<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> censured the geographer for his statement
that it had been Venetian, so completely had the Venetian tradition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
faded at the time of their visit in 1675. At that period, as they inform
us, the Sultan’s galleys never failed to come there every year to collect
the capitation tax, and the governor of the island was a Greek sent by
the Turks from Constantinople. Both travellers surmised, however,
that the island might perhaps have changed hands during the Candian
war, when it was neglected. Their surmise is rendered probable by the
remark of Sebastiani<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>, who visited it in 1666, during that long struggle.
For he says that it was then ecclesiastically under the jurisdiction of the
Catholic bishop of Tenos, who had begged the Venetian admiral, Comaro,
to give his deputy in Mykonos the old Venetian church of San Marco for
the use of the twenty Latin inhabitants. Randolph<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> confirms their story
of its subjection to the Sultan, for he tells of a visit paid to the island
by the Capitan Pasha in 1680. Piacenza<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> reiterates their criticism of
Baudrand, and mentions that the atlases of the Mediterranean erroneously
described it as <i>insula altera hoc in tractu maritimo Reipublicæ Venetæ
obsequium præstans</i>, whereas it was really “under the Turkish yoke.”
Dapper<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> takes the same view. After mentioning that Tenos “is the last
Venetian island in this quarter of the Levant” he adds that “there are
authors who allege that Mykonos is in subjection to Venice.” Finally,
in 1700, Tournefort<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> found the island dependent on the Capitan Pasha,
to whom it paid the capitation tax, while in the last war it had been
subject to the bey of Kos. Although, he says, it was conquered by
Barbarossa, the Venetian governor of Tenos still continues to style
himself <i>provveditore</i> of Mykonos also. But throughout the period of the
Candian war and right down to the end of the Venetian occupation of
Tenos the governor of the latter is always called simply <i>Rettor a Tine</i> in
the official registers<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. If further refutation were needed of Hopf’s
statement that Mykonos was captured from the Venetians in 1715, it
may be added that Ferrari<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>, the contemporary authority for the
surrender of Tenos, never mentions it, nor does it figure in the peace of
Passarovitz.</p>

<h3 id="heading18">13. SALONIKA</h3>

<p>Salonika, “the Athens of Mediæval Hellenism” and second to
Athens alone in contemporary Greece, has been by turns a Macedonian
provincial city, a free town under Roman domination, a Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
community second only to Constantinople, the capital of a short-lived
Latin kingdom and of a brief Greek empire to which it gave its name, a
Venetian colony, and a Turkish town<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>. There, in 1876, the murder of the
consuls was one of the phases of the Eastern crisis; there, in 1908, the
Young Turkish movement was born; there, in 1913, King George of
Greece was assassinated; and there in 1916 M. Venizelos established his
Provisional Government, in the city which served as a base for the Allies
in their Macedonian campaign.</p>

<p>Nor has Salonika’s contribution to literature been inconsiderable.
The historian Petros Patrikios in the sixth century; the essayist
Demetrios Kydones, who wrote a “monody over those who fell in
Salonika” in 1346, during the civil war between John Cantacuzene and
John V Palaiologos; John Kameniates and John the Reader, the
historians respectively of the Saracen and the Turkish sieges, and
Theodore Gazes, who contributed to spread Greek teaching in the West,
were natives of the place. Plotinos and John, hagiographers of the
seventh century; Leo, the famous mathematician of the ninth; Niketas,
who composed dialogues in favour of the union of the churches;
Eustathios, the Homeric commentator, historian of the Norman siege
and panegyrist of St Demetrios; Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos,
the ecclesiastical historian; Gregorios Palamas, Neilos, and Nicholas
Kabasilas, the polemical theologians of the fourteenth century; and
Symeon, the liturgical writer, who died just before the final Turkish
capture of the city, were among those who occupied this important
metropolitan see; while the rhetoricians, Nikephoros Choumnos and the
grammarian Thomas Magistros, addressed to the Thessalonians missives
on the blessings of justice and unity in the fourteenth century. And precedents
for the exile of Abdul Hamid II at Salonika may be found in the
banishment thither of Licinius, the rival of Constantine, of Anastasios II
in 716, and of Theodore Studita during the Iconoclast controversy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>Salonika has no very ancient history. It did not exist till after the
death of Alexander the Great, when Kassander, who became king of
Macedon, founded it in 315 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and gave to it the name of his wife,
Thessalonike, who was half-sister of the famous Macedonian conqueror,
just as he bestowed his own upon another town, from which the westernmost
of the three prongs of the peninsula of Chalkidike still retains the
name of Kassandra. When the Romans conquered and organized
Macedonia, Thessalonika became the capital of that province, remaining,
however, a free city with its own magistrates, the πολιτάρχαι, to whom
St Paul and Silas were denounced on their memorable visit. It is a proof
of the technical accuracy of the author of the Acts of the Apostles, that
this precise word occurs as the name of the local magistracy in the
inscription formerly on the Vardar gate, but now in the British Museum.
The description in the Acts further shows that the present large Jewish
colony of Salonika, which is mostly composed of Spanish Jews, descendants
of the fugitives from the persecutions of the end of the
fifteenth century, had already a counterpart in the first. We may infer
that Salonika was a prosperous town, and its importance in the Roman
period is shown by the fact that Cicero, who was not fond of discomfort,
selected it in 58 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> as his place of exile, and that Piso found it worth
plundering during his governorship. But the sojourn of the Roman
orator left a less durable mark upon the history of Salonika than that of
the Apostle. It was not merely that two of his comrades, Aristarchos
and Secundus, were Thessalonian converts, but mediæval Greek writers
lay special stress upon the piety of what was called <i>par excellence</i> “the
Orthodox City”—probably for its conservative attitude in the Iconoclast
controversy. Salonika furnished many names to the list of martyrs, and
one of them, St Demetrios, a Thessalonian doctor put to death in 306
by order of Galerius<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> became the patron of his native city, which he is
believed to have saved again and again from its foes. The most binding
Thessalonian oath was by his name<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>; his tomb, from which a holy oil
perpetually exuded, the source of many miraculous cures, is in the
beautiful building, now once more a church, which is called after him;
it was on his day, October 26 (<span class="allsmcap">O.S.</span>), that in 1912 Salonika capitulated to
the Greek troops, and there were peasant soldiers at the battle of
Sarantaporon who firmly believed that they had seen him fighting
against the Turks for the restoration of his church and city to his own
people<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>, just as their ancestors had beheld him, sword in hand, defending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
its walls against the Slavs. The story of his miracles forms a voluminous
literature, and on the walls of his church his grateful people represented
all the warlike episodes in which he had saved them from their foes.
Some of these mosaics have survived the conversion of the church into
the Kassimié mosque, and the great fire of August 18, 1917, and among
them is a portrait of the saint between a bishop and a local magnate.
Nor was St Demetrios the only Thessalonian saint. The city also
cherished the tomb of St Theodora of Ægina, who had died at Salonika
in the ninth century. Its walls contain the name of Pope Hormisdas.</p>

<p>Like Constantinople, Salonika was devoted to the sports of the
hippodrome; and, in 390, the imprisonment of a favourite charioteer on
the eve of a race, in which he was to have taken part, provoked an
insurrection, punished by a massacre. Theodosius I, then on his way to
Milan, ordered the Gothic garrison to wreak vengeance upon the
inhabitants; the next great race-meeting was selected, when the citizens
had come together to witness their favourite pastime, and 15,000 persons
were butchered in the hippodrome. St Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan,
refused to allow the Emperor to enter the cathedral, and made him
repent for eight months his barbarous treatment of a city where he had
celebrated his wedding. Of Roman Salonika there still exists a memorial
in the arch of Galerius, with its sculptures representing the Emperor’s
Asiatic victories; a second arch, the Vardar gate, was sacrificed fifty
years ago to build the quay; while a Corinthian colonnade, with eight
Karyatides, known to the Jews as <i>Las Incantadas</i>, a part of the Forum,
was removed by Napoleon III to France. The pulpit, from which St Paul
was believed to have spoken, and which used to stand outside the
church of St George, was removed—so I was informed when last at
Salonika—by a German in the time of Abdul Hamid.</p>

<p>Salonika had been chiefly important in Roman times, because the
Via Egnatia which ran from Durazzo, “the tavern of the Adriatic” (as
Catullus calls it), passed through its “Golden” and “Kassandreotic”
gates. But in Byzantine days its value was increased owing to its
geographical position. As long as the Exarchate of Ravenna existed, it
lay on the main artery uniting Constantinople with the Byzantine
province in Northern Italy, and it was an outpost against the Slavonic
tribes, which had entered the Balkan peninsula, where they have ever
since remained, but which, despite many attempts, have never taken
Salonika. Of these invaders the most formidable, and the most persistent,
were the Bulgarians, whose first war with their natural enemies,
the Greeks, was waged for the possession of Salonika, because of the
heavy customs dues which they had to pay there, and who, more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
a thousand years later, still covet that great Macedonian port, the
birthplace of the Slavonic apostles, the brothers Constantine (or Cyril)
and Methodios.</p>

<p>The influence of these two natives of Salonika, partly historical and
partly legendary, has not only spread over the Slavonic parts of the
Balkan peninsula, but forms in the church of San Clemente a link between
the Balkans and Rome. The brothers were intended by nature to
supplement one another: Constantine was a recluse and an accomplished
linguist, Methodios a man of the world and an experienced administrator.
Both brothers converted the Slavs of Moravia to Christianity, and it
was long believed that a terrifying picture of the Last Judgement from
the hand of Methodios had such an effect upon the mind of Boris, the
Bulgarian prince, that he embraced the Christian creed. The real fact is,
that Boris changed his religion (like his namesake in our own day) for
political reasons, as a condition of obtaining peace from the Byzantine
Emperor, Michael III, in 864, taking in baptism the name of his imperial
sponsor. Tradition likewise attributes to Cyril the invention of the
Cyrillic alphabet, which still bears his name and is that of the Russians,
Serbs, and Bulgars. But Professor Bury<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>, the latest writer on this
question, considers that the alphabet invented by Cyril for the use of the
Bulgarian and Moravian converts was not the so-called Cyrillic (which
is practically the Greek alphabet with the addition of a few letters, and
would, therefore, be likely to offend the Slav national feeling), but the
much more complicated Glagolitic, which still lingers on in the Slavonic
part of Istria, on the Croatian coast, and in Northern Dalmatia. In
this language, accordingly, his translation of the Gospels and his
brother’s version of the Old Testament were composed, and old Slavonic
literature began with these two Thessalonians, whose names form to-day
the programme of Bulgarian, just as Dante Alighieri is of Italian
expansion. On another mission, to Cherson on the Black Sea, Cyril is
said to have discovered the relics of St Clement, who had suffered
martyrdom there by being tied to an anchor and flung into the waves.
He brought them to Rome, where the frescoes in San Clemente before
Monsignor Wilpert’s researches were believed to represent the Slavonic
apostles, Cyril before Michael III, and the transference of his remains
to that church from the Vatican—for he died in Rome in 869.</p>

<p>Thus sentimental and commercial reasons impelled the Bulgarians
to attack Salonika. Both the great Bulgarian Tsars of the tenth century,
Symeon and Samuel, strove to obtain it, and during the forty years for
which the famous Greek Emperor Basil, “the Bulgar-Slayer,” contended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
against Samuel for the mastery of Macedonia, Salonika was the
headquarters, and the shrine of its patron-saint the inspiration, of the
Greeks, as Ochrida was the capital of the Bulgars. We learn from the
historian Kedrenos that there was at the time a party which favoured
the Bulgarians in some of the Greek cities<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>; but in 1014 the Emperor,
like the King of the Hellenes in 1913, and in the same defile, called
by the Byzantine historian “Kleidion” (or “the key”)—which has been
identified with the gorge of the Struma, not far from the notorious fort
Roupel—utterly routed his rival, and took, like King Constantine,
the title of “Bulgar-Slayer.” Samuel escaped, only to die of shock at
the spectacle of the 15,000 blinded Bulgarian captives, each hundred
guided by a one-eyed centurion, whom the victor sent back to their Tsar.
Basil celebrated his triumph in the holy of holies of Hellenism, the
majestic Parthenon, then the church of Our Lady of Athens, where
frescoes executed at his orders still recall his visit and victory over the
Bulgarians. Thus the destruction of the first Bulgarian empire was
organised at Salonika and celebrated at Athens, just like the defeat of
the same enemies 900 years later. But even after the fall of the Bulgarian
empire we find a Bulgarian leader besieging Salonika for six days, and
only repulsed by the personal intervention of St Demetrios<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>, whom the
terrified Bulgarian prisoners declared that they had seen on horseback
leading the Greeks and breathing fire against the besiegers.</p>

<p>But Salonika was no longer a virgin fortress. An enemy even more
formidable than the Bulgarians had captured it, the Saracens, who from
823 to 961 were masters of Crete. Of this, the first of the three conquests
of Salonika, we have a description by a priest who was a native of the
city and an eye-witness of its capture, John Kameniates, as well as a
sermon by the patriarch Nicholas<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. The “first city of the Macedonians”
was indeed a goodly prize for the Saracen corsairs, whose base was “the
great Greek island.” Civic patriotism inspired the Thessalonian priest
with a charming picture of his home at the moment of this piratical raid,
in 904. He praises the natural outer harbour, formed by the projecting
elbow of the Ἔμβολον (the “Black Cape,” or Karaburun, of the
Turks)<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>; the security of the inner port, protected by an artificial mole;
the great city climbing up the hill behind it; the vineyards and hospitable
monasteries, whose inmates (unlike their modern successors) take no
thought of politics; the two lakes (now St Basil and Beshik), with their
ample supply of fish, which stretch almost across the neck of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Chalkidic peninsula; and to the west the great Macedonian plain
(treeless then, as now), but watered by the Axios (the modern Vardar)
and lesser streams. In times of peace Salonika was the <i>débouché</i> of the
Slavonic hinterland; the mart and stopping-place of the cosmopolitan
crowd of merchants who travelled along the great highway from West
to East that still intersected it; in short, both land and sea conspired to
enrich it. Unfortunately, it was almost undefended on the sea side, for
no one had ever contemplated any other danger than that from the
Slavs of the country, and the population was untrained for war, but
more versed in the learning of the schools and in the beautifully
melodious hymns of the splendid Thessalonian ritual.</p>

<p>On Sunday, July 29, fifty-four Saracen ships were sighted off Karaburun
under the command of Leo, a renegade, who on that account was
all the more anxious to display his animosity to his former co-religionists.
He at once detected the weak point of the defences—the low sea-wall,
which had not been put into a state of proper repair<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>,—and ordered his
men to scale them. This attempt failed, nor was a second, to burn the
“Roma” and the “Kassandreotic” gates on the east—the latter
destroyed in 1873—more serviceable. The admiral then fastened his
ships together by twos, and on each pair constructed wooden towers,
which overtopped the sea-wall. He then steered them to where the
water was deep right up to the base of the fortifications, and began to
fire with his brazen tubes. The sea-wall was abandoned by its terrified
defenders, and an Ethiopian climbing on to the top to see if their flight
were merely a ruse, when once he had assured himself that it was
genuine, summoned his comrades to follow him. A terrible massacre
ensued; some of the inhabitants occupied the Akropolis, then known as
“St David’s,” but now called “the Seven Towers,” whence a few Slavs
escaped into the country; others fled to the two western gates, “the
Golden” and “the Litaian”—the “New gate” of the Turks, destroyed
in 1911—where the besiegers butchered them as they were jammed
together in the gateways. Our author with his father, uncle, and two
brothers took refuge in a bastion of the walls opposite the church of
St Andrew. When the Ethiopians approached, he threw himself at the
feet of their captain, offering to reveal to him the hidden treasure of the
family, if the lives of himself and his relatives were spared. The captain
agreed, but the author did not escape two wounds from another band
of pillagers, and witnessed the massacre of some 300 of his fellow-citizens
in the church of St George. And, if his life had been spared, he was still
a captive; 800 prisoners, besides a crew of 200, were herded in the ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
which transported him to Crete, and he has described in vivid language
the horrors of that passage in the blazing days of August without air or
water. Over and above those who perished during the voyage, which
lasted a fortnight for fear of the Greek fleet, 22,000 captives were landed
to be sold as slaves. Even then his troubles were not over. A hurricane
sprang up on the voyage from Crete to Tripoli, and the narrative closes
as the author is anxiously awaiting at Tarsus the hour of his liberation.
A curious illustration in a manuscript of Skylitzes remains, like his story,
to remind us of this siege.</p>

<p>Salonika recovered from the ravages of the Saracens, who later in
the tenth century were driven out of Crete, and the collapse of the
Bulgarians in the eleventh enabled her to develop her trade. Three
churches, of St Elias, of the Virgin, and of St Panteleemon, date from
this period, to which belong the extant seals of Constantine Diogenes,
Basil II’s lieutenant, and of the Metropolitans Paul and Leo<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>. The
Byzantine satire, <i>Timarion</i><a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>, which was composed in the twelfth century,
gives an interesting account of the fair of St Demetrios, to which came
not only Greeks from all parts of the Hellenic world, but also Slavs from
the Danubian lands, Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Celts from
beyond the Alps. It is curious that this list omits the Jews, now such an
important element at Salonika, for they are mentioned in the seventh
century, and Benjamin of Tudela, who visited the city about the time
that <i>Timarion</i> was written, found 500 there<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>. As for Italians, we hear of
Venetians and Pisans obtaining trading-rights, and having their own
quarter and the distinctive name of Βουργιέσιοι<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.</p>

<p>Not long after the brilliant scene described by the Byzantine satirist
a terrible misfortune befell Salonika—its capture by the Normans of
Sicily. The usurper, Andronikos I, then sat on the throne, and Alexios,
a nephew of the late Emperor Manuel I, fled to the court of William II
of Sicily, and implored his assistance. William consented, and despatched
an army to Salonika by way of Durazzo, and a fleet round the Peloponnese.
On August 6, 1185, the land force began the siege, of which
the Archbishop Eustathios, the commentator on Homer, was an eye-witness
and historian. Salonika was commanded by David Comnenos,
who bore a great Byzantine name, but was—by the accordant testimony
of another contemporary, Niketas, who describes him as “more craven
than a deer,” and of the archbishop, who calls him “little better than a
traitor”—a lazy, cowardly, and incompetent officer, who, in order to
prevent his supersession by some one more capable, sent a series of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
lying bulletins to the capital, that all was well. The walls were in good
repair, except (as in 904) at the harbour, but the reservoir in the castle
leaked; and many of the most capable inhabitants had been allowed to
escape. Still the remainder, and not least the women, who completely
put to shame the effeminate commander on his pacific mule, showed
bravery and patriotism, while the archbishop specially mentions the
courage of some Serbians in the garrison<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>. There were, however, traitors
in the city and neighbourhood—Jews and Armenians, and on August 24
the city fell. The conduct of the learned archbishop at this crisis was in
marked contrast with that of the miserable commander. Eustathios
acted like a true pastor of his flock. The invaders found him calmly
awaiting them in his palace, whence, seizing him by his venerable beard,
they dragged him to the hippodrome, and thence, through lines of
corpses, to the arsenal. There he was put on board the ship of a pirate,
who demanded 4000 gold pieces as his ransom. As the archbishop
pleaded poverty, he was next day escorted to the presence of Alexios
himself, and thence to Counts Aldoin and Richard of Acerra, by whom
he was at last restored to his palace, where he took refuge in a tiny bathroom
in the garden.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Normans had shown no respect for the churches of
the city. They danced upon the altars; they used the sacred ointment
which flowed from the tomb of St Demetrios as boot-polish; they
interrupted the singing by their obscene melodies and imitated the nasal
intonation of the eastern priesthood by barking like dogs. But it is best
to pass over the revolting details of the sack, for which the only excuse
was the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople three years earlier.
Eustathios, by his influence with Count Aldoin, was able to mitigate
some of the tortures of his flock; he describes the miserable plight of
these poor wretches, robbed of their houses and almost stark naked,
and the strange appearance which they presented (like the Messina
refugees after the earthquake of 1908) in their improvised hats and
clothes. More than 7000 of them had perished in the assault, but the
archbishop notes with satisfaction that the Normans lost some 3000
from their excessive indulgence in pork and new wine. Vengeance, too,
soon befell them. A Greek army under Alexios Branas defeated them
on the Struma, and in November they evacuated Salonika<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>. But their
treatment of Salonika embittered the hatred between Latins and Greeks,
and prepared the way for the Fourth Crusade.</p>

<p>Barely twenty years after the Norman capture, Salonika became the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
capital of a Latin kingdom. Boniface, marquess of Montferrat, was the
leader of the crusaders who, with the help of the Venetians, overthrew
the Greek empire in 1204, and partitioned it into Latin states. Of these
the most important after the Latin empire, of which Constantinople
became the capital, was the so-called Latin kingdom of Salonika, of
which Boniface was appointed king, and which, nominally dependent
upon the Latin Emperor, embraced Macedonia, Thessaly, and much of
continental Greece, including Athens. Of all the artificial creations of
the Fourth Crusade, which should be a warning to those who believe
that nations can be partitioned permanently at congresses of diplomatists,
the Latin kingdom of Salonika was the first to fall. From the outset its
existence was undermined by jealousy between its king and the Latin
Emperor, whose suzerainty he and his proud Lombard nobles were loath
to acknowledge. For this reason Boniface, whose wife, Margaret of
Hungary, was widow of the Greek Emperor, Isaac II, endeavoured to
cultivate his Greek subjects. But, in 1207, he was killed by the Bulgarians,
who would have taken Salonika, had not a traitor (or, as the
pious believed, St Demetrios) slain their tsar.</p>

<p>Boniface’s son, although born in the country and named after
Salonika’s patron-saint (whose church was, however, the property of the
chapter of the Holy Sepulchre while a Latin archbishop occupied the
see), was then barely two years old. His mother was regent, but the real
power was wielded by her bailie, the ambitious count of Biandrate, whose
policy was to separate the kingdom from the Latin empire and draw it
closer to the Italian marquisate. His quarrels with the Emperor Henry
were viewed with joy by the Greeks; and, after his retirement, and in
the absence of the young king in Italy, the kingdom was easily occupied,
in 1223, by Theodore Angelos<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>, the vigorous ruler of Epeiros, where, as
at Nice, the city of the famous council, Hellenism, temporarily exiled
from its natural capital, had found a refuge. The Greek conqueror
exchanged the more modest title of “Despot of Epeiros” for that of
“Emperor of Salonika,” while the exiled monarch and his successors
continued to amuse themselves by styling themselves titular kings of
Salonika for another century. But the separate Greek empire of Salonika
was destined to live but little longer than the Latin kingdom. The first
Greek Emperor, by one of those sudden reverses of fortune so characteristic
of Balkan politics in all ages, fell into the hands of the Bulgarians;
and, after having been reduced to the lesser dignity of a Despotat, the
empire which he had founded was finally annexed, in 1246, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
stronger and rival Greek empire of Nice, which, in 1261, likewise
absorbed the Latin empire of Constantinople. No coins of the Latin
kingdom exist; but we have a seal of Boniface, with a representation of
the city walls upon it. Of the Greek empire of Salonika there are silver
and bronze pieces, bearing the figure of the city’s patron-saint; while a
tower contains an inscription to “Manuel the Despot,” identified by
Monsignor Duchesne<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> with Manuel Angelos (1230-40), the Emperor
Theodore’s brother and successor, but locally ascribed to a Manuel
Palaiologos, perhaps the subsequent Emperor Manuel II, Despot and
governor of Salonika in 1369-70.</p>

<p>Salonika, restored to the Byzantine empire, enjoyed special privileges,
second only to those of the capital. Together with the region
around it, it was considered as an appanage of one of the Emperor’s sons
(<i>e.g.</i> John VII, nephew, and Andronikos, son of Manuel II). It was
sometimes governed by the Empresses, two of them Italians, Jolanda of
Montferrat, wife of Andronikos II, a descendant of the first king of
Salonika, and Anne of Savoy, wife of Andronikos III, who was commemorated
in an inscription over the gate of the castle, which she
repaired in 1355. The court frequently resided there: we find Andronikos
III coming to be healed by the saint, and the beauteous Jolanda,
when she quarrelled with her husband, retired to Salonika and
scandalised Thessalonian society with her accounts of her domestic life.
As in our own day, Salonika was the favourite seat of opposition to the
imperial authority. During the civil wars of the fourteenth century,
such as those between the elder and the younger Andronikos and
between John V Palaiologos and John Cantacuzene, it supported the
candidate opposed to Constantinople, so that we may find precedents
in its mediæval history for its selection as the headquarters of the Young
Turkish movement. It enjoyed a full measure of autonomy, had its own
“senate,” elected its own officials, was defended by its own civic guard,
and administered by its own municipal customs. It even sent its own
envoys abroad to discuss commercial questions. Its annual fair on the
festival of St Demetrios still attracted traders from all the Levant to
the level space between the walls and the Vardar. Jews, Slavs, and
Armenians, as well as Greeks, crowded its bazaars; scholars from outside
frequented its high schools, and Demetrios Kydones<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> compared it with
Athens at its best.</p>

<p>The fourteenth century was, indeed, the golden age of Salonika in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
art and letters. The erection of the churches of the Twelve Apostles and
St Catherine continued the tradition of the much earlier churches of
St George, St Sophia, and St Demetrios. The clergy followed in the
footsteps of the learned Eustathios, and the beauty, wit, and reading of
a Thessalonian lady, Eudokia Palaiologina, turned the head of a son of
Andronikos II, when governor of Salonika, “that garden of the Muses
and the Graces,” as one of the literary archbishops of the fourteenth
century called it. The intellectual activity of the place led to intense
theological discussion, and at this period the “Orthodox” city <i>par
excellence</i> was agitated by the heresy of the “Hesychasts,” or Quietists,
who believed that complete repose would enable them to see a divine
light flickering round their empty stomachs, while the so-called “Zealots,”
or friends of the people, with the cross as their banner, practised in
Salonika the doctrines of Wat Tyler and Jack Cade in mediæval England.
The exploitation of the poor by the rich and the tax-collectors, and the
example of the recent revolution at Genoa, caused this republican
movement, which led to the massacre of the nobles in 1346 by hurling
them from the castle walls into the midst of an armed mob below. The
“Zealots,” like the Iconoclast Emperors, have suffered from the fact
that they have been described by their enemies, and notably by Cantacuzene<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>,
to whose aristocratic party they were opposed. Yet even an
archbishop publicly advocated so drastic a measure as the suppression
of some of the monasteries, in order to provide funds for the better
defence of the city; nor was there anything very alarming in their
preference for direct taxation. Thus, Salonika was from 1342 to 1349,
under their auspices, practically an independent republic, till they
succumbed to the allied forces of the aristocracy and the monks.</p>

<p>Salonika, indeed, continued to have urgent need of its walls, which
still remain, save where the Turks completely dismantled them on the
sea side in 1866, a fine example of Byzantine fortification. Andronikos II
strengthened them by the erection of a tower, which still bears his
initials, in the dividing wall between the Akropolis and the rest of the
city. Thanks to them it escaped pillage by the Catalan Grand Company
at a time when they sheltered two Byzantine Empresses. Even during
the greatest expansion of the Serbian empire under Stephen Dushan,
Salonika alone remained a Greek islet in a Serbian Macedonia. But a far
more serious foe than either Catalan or Serb was now at hand. The
Turks entered Europe shortly after the middle of the fourteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
and advanced rapidly in the direction of Salonika. At least twice<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
before the end of that century—in 1387 and from 1391 to 1403, when
Suleyman handed it back—they occupied it, and at last the inhabitants
came to the conclusion that, in the weak condition of the Greek empire,
their sole chance of safety was to place themselves under the protection
of a great maritime power. Accordingly, in 1423, pressed by famine and
by continual Turkish attacks, the Greek notables sent a deputation to
Venice offering their city to the republic, whether their sickly Despot
Andronikos, son of the Emperor Manuel II, consented or no. The
Venetians, we are told, “received the offer with gladness, and promised
to protect, and nourish, and prosper the city and to transform it into
a second Venice.” The Despot, whose claims were settled by a solatium
of 50,000 ducats, made way for a Venetian duke and a captain; for seven
years Salonika was a Venetian colony<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.</p>

<p>The bargain proved unsatisfactory alike to the Venetians and the
Greeks. Their brief occupation of Salonika cost the republic 700,000
ducats—for, in 1426, in addition to the cost of administration and repairs
to the walls, she agreed to pay a tribute to the Sultan. Nor was it
popular with the natives, especially the notables, many of whom the
government found it desirable to deport to the other Venetian colonies
of Negroponte and Crete, or even to Venice itself, on the plea that there
was not food for them at Salonika. Others left voluntarily for Constantinople
to escape the “unbearable horrors” and the Venetian
slavery. The Turkish peril was ever present, and when envoys solicited
peace from the Sultan Murad II, he replied: “The city is my inheritance,
and my grandfather Bayezid took it from the Greeks by his own right
hand. So, if the Greeks were now its masters, they might reasonably
accuse me of injustice. But ye being Latins and from Italy, what have
ye to do with this part of the world? Go, if you like; if not, I am coming
quickly.” And in 1430 he came.</p>

<p>Two misfortunes preceded the fall of Salonika—the death of the
beloved metropolitan, and an earthquake. There was only one man to
defend every two or three bastions, and the Venetians, distrusting the
inhabitants, placed a band of brigands between themselves and the
Greeks, so that, even if the latter had desired to accept the liberal offers
which Murad made them, they dared not do so. Chalkokondyles hints<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
at treachery, and a versifying chronicler<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> makes the monks of the present
Tsaoush-Monastir near the citadel urge the Sultan to cut the conduits
from the mountain, which supplied the city with water, and ascribes to
their treason their subsequent privileges. But even the wives of the
Greek notables joined in the defence, until a move of the Venetian
garrison towards the harbour led the Greeks to believe that they would
be left to their fate. On March 29, the fourth day of the siege, a soldier
scaled the walls at the place near the castle known as “The Triangle,”
and threw down the head of a Venetian as a sign that he was holding his
ground. The defenders fled to the Samareia tower<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> on the beach—perhaps
the famous “White Tower,” or “the Tower of Blood” as it was
called a century ago, which still stands there and which some attribute
to the Venetian period, or at least to Venetian workmen—only to find
it shut against them by the Venetians, who managed to escape by sea.</p>

<p>In accordance with his promise, Murad allowed his men to sack the
city, and great damage was inflicted on the churches in the search for
treasure buried beneath the altars. The tomb of St Demetrios was
ravaged, because of its rich ornaments and to obtain the healing ointment
for which it was famous, while the relics of St Theodora were scattered,
and with difficulty collected again. Seeing, however, the wonderful
situation of Salonika, the Sultan ordered the sack to cease, and began
to restore the houses to their owners, contenting himself with converting
only two of the churches, those of the Virgin and of St John Baptist,
into mosques. It is pleasant to note that George Brankovich, the Despot
of Serbia and one of the richest princes of that day, ransomed many
prisoners. Two or three years afterwards, however, the Sultan adopted
severer measures towards the captured city. He took all the churches
except four (including that of St Demetrios, which, as the tomb of
Spantounes shows, was not converted into a mosque till after 1481),
built a bath out of the materials of some of the others, and transported
the Turks of Yenidjé-Vardar to Salonika, which thus for 482 years
became a Turkish city. Chalkokondyles<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> was not far wrong when he
described its fall as “the greatest disaster that had yet befallen the
Greeks.”</p>

<p>When, on St Demetrios’ day, 1912, the victorious Greeks recovered
Salonika, all those churches, sixteen in number, which had existed
before the Turkish conquest were reconverted into Christian edifices;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
and when I was there in 1914, it was curious to see the two dates, 1430
and 1912, the former in black, the latter in gold, on the eikonostasis of
the Divine Wisdom, the church which was perhaps founded before the
more famous St Sophia of Constantinople. Almost the last acts of the
Young Turks before they surrendered Salonika were to destroy not
only the “Gate of Anna Palaiologina,” but also the “New Gate,” which
bore the inscription recording the Turkish capture.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="heading19">I. THE ZACCARIA OF PHOCÆA AND CHIOS (1275-1329)</h3>

<p>Genoa played a much less important part than Venice in the history
of Greece. Unlike her great rival on the lagoons, she had no
Byzantine traditions which attracted her towards the Near East, and it
is not, therefore, surprising to find her appearing last of all the Italian
Republics in the Levant. But, though she took no part in the Fourth
Crusade, her sons, the Zaccaria and the Gattilusj, later on became petty
sovereigns in the Ægean; the long administration of Chios by the
Genoese society of the Giustiniani is one of the earliest examples of the
government of a colonial dependency by a Chartered Company, and it
was Genoa who gave to the principality of Achaia its last ruler in the
person of Centurione Zaccaria.</p>

<p>The earliest relations between Genoa and Byzantium are to be found
in the treaty between the two in 1155; but it was not till a century later
that the Ligurian Republic seriously entered into the field of Eastern
politics. After the establishment of the Latin states in Greece, the
Genoese, excluded from all share of the spoil, endeavoured to embarrass
their more fortunate Venetian rivals by secretly urging on their countryman,
the pirate Vetrano, against Corfù, and by instigating the bold
Ligurian, Enrico Pescatore, against Crete—enterprises, however, which
had no permanent effect. But the famous treaty of Nymphæum, concluded
between the Emperor Michael VIII and the Republic of Genoa in
1261, first gave the latter a <i>locus standi</i> in the Levant. Never did a Latin
Community make a better bargain with a Greek ruler, for all the
advantages were on the side of Genoa. The Emperor gave her establishments
and the right to keep consuls at Anæa, in Chios, and in Lesbos,
both of which important islands had been assigned to the Latin Empire
by the deed of partition, but had been recaptured by Michael’s predecessor
Vatatzes in 1225<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. He also granted her the city of Smyrna,
promised free trade to Genoese merchants in all the ports of his
dominions, and pledged himself to exclude the enemies of the Ligurian
Commonwealth, in other words, the Venetians, from the Black Sea and
all his harbours. All that he asked in return for these magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
concessions was an undertaking that Genoa would arm a squadron of
fifty ships at his expense, if he asked for it. It was expressly stipulated
that this armament should not be employed against Prince William of
Achaia. Genoa performed her part of the bargain by sending a small fleet
to aid the Emperor in the recovery of Constantinople from the Latins;
but it arrived too late to be of any use. Still, Michael VIII took the will
for the deed; he needed Genoese aid for his war against Venice; so he
sent an embassy to ask for more galleys. The Genoese, heedless of papal
thunders against this “unholy alliance,” responded by raising a loan for
the affairs of the Levant<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>; and it was their fleet, allied with the Greeks,
which sustained the defeat off the islet of Spetsopoulo, or Sette Pozzi,
as the Italians called it<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>, at the mouth of the Gulf of Nauplia in 1263.
But the Emperor soon found that his new allies were a source of danger
rather than of strength; he banished the Genoese of Constantinople to
Eregli on the Sea of Marmara, and made his peace with their Venetian
rivals. In vain Genoa sent Benedetto Zaccaria to induce him to revoke
his decree of expulsion; some years seem to have elapsed before he
allowed the Genoese to return to Galata, and it was not till 1275 that the
formal ratification of the treaty of Nymphæum marked his complete
return to his old policy<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>, and that Manuele and Benedetto Zaccaria
became the recipients of his bounty.</p>

<p>The Zaccaria were at this time one of the leading families of Genoa,
whither they had emigrated from the little Ligurian town of Gavi some
two centuries earlier. The grandfather of Manuele and Benedetto, who
derived his territorial designation of “de Castro,” from the district of
Sta Maria di Castello, in which he resided, had held civic office in 1202;
their father Fulcho had been one of the signatories of the treaty of
Nymphæum<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>. Three years before that event Benedetto had been
captured by the Venetians in a battle off Tyre. Three years after it, he
was sent as Genoese ambassador to Michael VIII and, though his
mission was unsuccessful, the Emperor had the opportunity of appreciating
his business-like qualities<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>. Early in 1275, the year when Genoa
had returned to favour at the Imperial Court, the two brothers started
from their native city upon the voyage to Constantinople, which was
destined to bring them fame and fortune—to Manuele, the elder, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
grant of the alum-mines of Phocæa at the north of the Gulf of Smyrna,
to Benedetto the hand of the Emperor’s sister<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>. Phocæa at that time
consisted of a single town, situated to the west of the alum-mountains;
but, later on, the encroachments of the Turks led its Latin lords to build
on the sea-shore at the foot of the mountain a small fortress sufficient to
shelter about fifty workmen, which, with the aid of their Greek neighbours,
grew into the town of New Phocæa, or Foglia Nuova, as the
Italians called it. The annual rent, which Manuele paid to the Emperor,
was covered many times over by the profits of the mines. Alum was
indispensable for dyeing, and Western ships homeward-bound were
therefore accustomed to take a cargo of this useful product at Phocæa<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.
The only serious competition with the trade was that of the alum which
came from the coasts of the Black Sea, and which was exported to
Europe in Genoese bottoms. A man of business first and a patriot afterwards,
Manuele persuaded the Emperor to ensure him a monopoly of
the market by prohibiting this branch of the Euxine trade—a protective
measure, which led to difficulties with Genoa. He was still actively
engaged in business operations at Phocæa in 1287, but is described as
dead in the spring of the following year<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>, after which date the alum-mines
of Phocæa passed to his still more adventurous brother, Benedetto.</p>

<p>While Manuele had been accumulating riches at Phocæa, Benedetto
had gained the reputation of being one of the most daring seamen, as
well as one of the ablest negotiators, of his time. He was instrumental,
as agent of Michael VIII, in stirring up the Sicilian Vespers and so
frustrating the threatened attack of Charles I of Anjou upon the Greek
Empire, and later in that year we find him proposing the marriage of
Michael’s son and the King of Aragon’s daughter<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>. In the following years
he was Genoese Admiral in the Pisan War, and led an expedition to
Tunis; in 1288 he was sent to Tripoli with full powers to transact all the
business of the Republic beyond the seas. After negotiating with both
the claimants to the last of the Crusaders’ Syrian states, he performed
the more useful action of conveying the people of Tripoli to Cyprus,
when, in the following year, that once famous city fell before the Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
of Egypt. In Cyprus he concluded with King Henry II a treaty, which
gave so little satisfaction to the home government, that it was speedily
cancelled. More successful was the commercial convention which he
made with Leo III of Armenia, followed by a further agreement with
that monarch’s successor, Hethum II. But his rashness in capturing an
Egyptian ship compelled the Republic to disown him, and in 1291 he
sought employment under a new master, Sancho IV of Castile, as whose
Admiral he defeated the Saracens off the coast of Morocco<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>. From Spain
he betook himself to the court of Philip IV of France, to whom, with
characteristic audacity, he submitted in 1296 a plan for the invasion of
England<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>. During his absence in the West, however, war broke out
between the Genoese and the Venetians, whose Admiral, Ruggiero
Morosini, took Phocæa and seized the huge cauldrons which were used
for the preparation of the alum<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>. But upon his return he speedily
repaired the walls of the city, and ere long the alum-mines yielded more
than ever. Nor was this his only source of revenue, for under his brother
and himself Phocæa had become a name of terror to the Latin pirates
of the Levant, upon whom the famous <i>Tartarin</i> of the Zaccaria ceaselessly
preyed, and who lost their lives, or at least their eyes, if they fell
into the hands of the redoubtable Genoese captains<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. The sums thus
gained Benedetto devoted in part to his favourite project for the recovery
of the Holy Land, for which he actually equipped several vessels with
the aid of the ladies of his native city—a pious act that won them the
praise of Pope Boniface VIII, who described him as his “old, familiar
friend<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>.” This new crusade, indeed, came to nought, but such was the
renown which he and his brother had acquired, that the Turks, by this
time masters of the Asian coast, and occupants of the short-lived
Genoese colony of Smyrna, were deterred from attacking Phocæa, not
because of its natural strength but because of the warlike qualities of
its Italian garrison. Conscious of their own valour and of the weakness
of the Emperor Andronikos II, the Genoese colonists did not hesitate
to ask him to entrust them with the defence of the neighbouring islands,
if he were unable to defend that portion of his Empire himself. They only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
stipulated that they should be allowed to defray the cost out of the local
revenues, which would thus be expended on the spot, instead of being
transmitted to Constantinople. Benedetto had good reason for making
this offer; for Chios and Lesbos, once the seats of flourishing Genoese
factories under the rule of the Greek Emperor and his father, had both
suffered severely from the feeble policy of the central government and
the attacks of corsairs. Twice, in 1292 and 1303, the troops first of Roger
de Lluria and then of Roger de Flor had ravaged Mytilene and devastated
the famous mastic-gardens of Chios—the only place in the world where
that product was to be found, while a Turkish raid completed the
destruction of that beautiful island<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>.</p>

<p>Andronikos received Benedetto’s proposal with favour, but as he
delayed giving a definite decision, the energetic Genoese, like the man
of action that he was, occupied Chios in 1304 on his own account. The
Emperor, too much engaged with the Turkish peril to undertake the
expulsion of this desperate intruder, wisely recognised accomplished
facts, and agreed to let him have the island for ten years as a fief of the
Empire, free of all tribute, on condition that he flew the Byzantine
standard from the walls and promised to restore his conquest to his
suzerain at the expiration of the lease<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>. Thus, in the fashion of Oriental
diplomacy, both parties were satisfied: the Italian had gained the
substance of power, while the Greek retained the shadow, and might
salve his dignity with the reflexion that the real ruler of Chios hoisted
his colours, owed him allegiance, and was a near kinsman of his own by
marriage.</p>

<p>This first Genoese occupation of Chios lasted only a quarter of a
century; but even in that short time, under the firm and able rule of the
Zaccaria, it recovered its former prosperity. Benedetto refortified the
capital, restored the fallen buildings, heightened the walls, and deepened
the ditch—significant proofs of his intention to stay. Entrusting
Phocæa to the care of his nephew Tedisio, or Ticino, as his deputy, he
devoted his attention to the revival of Chios, which at his death, in 1307,
he bequeathed to his son, Paleologo, first-cousin of the reigning Emperor,
while he left Phocæa to his half-brother, Nicolino, like himself a naval
commander in the Genoese service. This division of the family possessions
led to difficulties. Nicolino arrived at Phocæa and demanded
a full statement of account from his late brother’s manager, Tedisio;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
the latter consented, but the uncle and the nephew did not agree about
the figures, and Nicolino withdrew, threatening to return with a larger
force, to turn Tedisio out of his post, convey him to Genoa, and appoint
another governor, Andriolo Cattaneo della Volta, a connexion of the
family by marriage, in his place. Nicolino’s son privately warned his
cousin of his father’s intentions, and advised him to quit Phocæa while
there was still time. At this moment the Catalan Grand Company was
at Gallipoli, and there Tedisio presented himself, begging the chronicler
Muntaner to enroll him in its ranks. The Catalan, moved by his aristocratic
antecedents and personal courage, consented, and soon the fugitive
ex-governor, by glowing accounts of the riches of Phocæa, induced his
new comrades to aid him in capturing the place from his successor. The
Catalans were always ready for plunder, and the alum-city was said to
contain “the richest treasures of the world.” Accordingly, a flotilla was
equipped, which arrived off Phocæa on the night of Easter 1307. Before
daybreak next morning, the assailants had scaled the walls of the castle;
then they sacked the city, whose population of more than 3000 Greeks
was employed in the alum-manufactory. The booty was immense, and
not the least precious portion of it was a piece of the true Cross, encased
in gold and studded with priceless jewels. This relic, said to have been
brought by St John the Evangelist to Ephesus, captured by the Turks
when they took that place, and pawned by them at Phocæa, fell to the
lot of Muntaner<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>. This famous “Cross of the Zaccaria” would seem to
have been restored to that family, and we may conjecture that it was
presented to the cathedral of Genoa, where it now is, by the bastard son
of the last Prince of the Morea<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>, when, in 1459, he begged the city of his
ancestors to recommend him to the generosity of Pius II. Emboldened
by this success, Tedisio, with the aid of the Catalans, conquered the
island of Thasos from the Greeks and received his friend Muntaner and
the Infant Ferdinand of Majorca in its castle with splendid hospitality.
Six years later, however, the Byzantine forces recovered this island,
whence the Zaccaria preyed upon Venetian merchantmen<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>, and it was
not for more than a century that a Genoese lord once again held his
court in the fortress of Tedisio Zaccaria.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Paleologo, in Chios, had continued the enlightened policy
of his father, and reaped his reward in the renewed productiveness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
the mastic-plantations. In 1314, when the ten years’ lease of the
island expired, the strong fortifications, which his father had erected,
and his near relationship to the Emperor procured him a renewal for
five more years on the same terms<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>. He did not, however, long enjoy
this further tenure, for in the same year he died, apparently without
progeny. As his uncle, Nicolino, the lord of Phocæa and the next
heir, was by this time also dead, the latter’s sons, Martino and
Benedetto II, succeeded their cousin as joint-rulers of Chios, while
Phocæa passed beneath the direct control of Nicolino’s former
governor, Andriolo Cattaneo, always, of course, subject to the confirmation
of the Emperor.</p>

<p>The two brothers, who had thus succeeded to Chios, possessed all the
vigorous qualities of their race. One contemporary writer after another
praises their services to Christendom, and describes the terror with which
they filled the Turks. The Infidels, we are told, were afraid to approach
within twelve miles of Chios, because of the Zaccaria, who always kept
a thousand foot-soldiers, a hundred horsemen, and a couple of galleys
ready for every emergency. Had it not been for the valour of the
Genoese lords of Chios “neither man, nor woman, nor dog, nor cat, nor
any live animal could have remained in any of the neighbouring islands.”
Not only were the brothers “the shield of defence of the Christians,” but
they did all they could to stop the infamous traffic in slaves, carried on
by their fellow-countrymen, the Genoese of Alexandria, whose vessels
passed Chios on the way from the Black Sea ports. Pope John XXII, who
had already allowed Martino to export mastic to Alexandria in return
for his services, was therefore urged to give the Zaccaria the maritime
police of the Archipelago, so that this branch of the slave-trade might be
completely cut off<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>. Sanudo<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>, with his accurate knowledge of the Ægean,
remarked that the islands could not have resisted the Turks so long, had
it not been for the Genoese rulers of Chios, Duke Nicolò I of Naxos, and
the Holy House of the Hospital, established since 1309 in Rhodes, and
estimated that the Zaccaria could furnish a galley for the recovery of
the Holy Land. Martino was specially renowned for his exploits against
the Turks. No man, it was said, had ever done braver deeds at sea than
this defender of the Christians and implacable foe of the Paynim. In
one year alone he captured 18 Turkish pirate ships, and at the end of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
reign he had slain or taken more than 10,000 Turks<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>. The increased
importance of Chios at this period is evidenced by the coins, which the
two brothers minted for their use, sometimes with the diplomatic
legend, “servants of the Emperor<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>.” Benedetto II was, however,
eclipsed by the greater glories of Martino. By marriage the latter became
baron of Damala and by purchase<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> lord of Chalandritza in the Peloponnese,
and thus laid the foundations of his family’s fortunes in the
principality of Achaia. He was thereby brought into close relations with
the official hierarchy of the Latin Orient, from which the Zaccaria, as
Genoese traders, had hitherto been excluded. Accordingly, in 1325,
Philip I of Taranto, who, in virtue of his marriage with Catherine of
Valois, was titular Latin Emperor of Constantinople, bestowed upon
him the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Kos, and Chios, which Baldwin II
had reserved for himself and his successors in the treaty of Viterbo in
1267,—a reservation repeated in 1294—together with those of Ikaria,
Tenedos, Œnoussa, and Marmara, and the high-sounding title of “King
and Despot of Asia Minor,” in return for his promise to furnish 500
horsemen and six galleys a year whenever the “Emperor” came into
his own<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>. The practical benefits of this magnificent diploma were small—for
Martino already ruled in Chios, with which Samos and Kos seem
to have been united under the sway of the Zaccaria, while the other
places mentioned belonged either to the Greeks or the Turks, over whom
the phantom Latin Emperor had no power whatever. Indeed, this
investiture by the titular ruler of Constantinople must have annoyed
its actual sovereign, who had not, however, dared to refuse the renewal
of the lease of Chios, when it again expired in 1319.</p>

<p>But Martino had given hostages to fortune by his connexion with
the Morea. His son, Bartolommeo, was captured by the Catalans of
Athens in one of their campaigns, sent off to the custody of their
patron, Frederick II of Sicily, and only released at the request of
Pope John XXII in 1318. As the husband of the young Marchioness
of Boudonitza, he was mixed up also in the politics of Eubœa and
the mainland opposite, while he is mentioned as joining the other
members of his family in their attacks upon the Turks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>For a time Martino managed to preserve good relations with the
Greek Empire. In 1324, the lease of Chios was again renewed, and in
1327 Venice instructed her officials in the Levant to negotiate a league
with him, the Greek Emperor, and the Knights against the common
peril<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>. But by this time the dual system of government in the island had
broken down: Martino’s great successes had led him to desire the sole
management of Chios, and he had accordingly ousted his brother from
all share in the government and struck coins for the island with his own
name alone, as he did for his barony of Damala<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>. His riches had become
such as to arouse the suspicions of the Imperial Government that he
would not long be content to admit himself “the servant of the Emperor”;
the public dues of the island amounted to 120,000 gold pieces a year,
while the Turks paid an annual tribute to its dreaded ruler, in order to
escape his attacks. It happened that, in 1328, when the quinquennial
lease had only another year to run and the usual negotiations for its
renewal should have begun, that Andronikos III, a warlike and energetic
prince, mounted the throne of Constantinople, and this conjunction of
circumstances seemed to the national party in Chios peculiarly favourable
to its reconquest. Accordingly, the leading Greek of the island, Leon
Kalothetos, who was an intimate friend of the new sovereign’s Prime
Minister, John Cantacuzene, sought an interview with the latter’s
mother, whom he interested in his plans. She procured him an audience
of the Emperor and of her son, and they both encouraged him with
presents and promises to support the expedition which they were ready
to undertake. An excuse for hostilities was easily found in the new
fortress which Martino was then engaged in constructing without the
consent of his suzerain. An ultimatum was therefore sent to him
ordering him to desist from his building operations, and to come in
person to Constantinople, if he wished to renew his lease. Martino, as
might have been expected from his character, treated the ultimatum
with contempt, and only hastened on his building. Benedetto, however,
took the opportunity to lodge a complaint against his brother before the
Emperor, claiming 60,000 gold pieces, the present annual amount of his
half-share in the island, which he had inherited but of which the grasping
Martino had deprived him.</p>

<p>In the early autumn of 1329, Andronikos assembled a magnificent
fleet of 105 vessels, including four galleys furnished by Duke Nicolò I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
of Naxos, with the ostensible object of attacking the Turks but with the
real intention of subduing the Genoese lord of Chios. Even at this
eleventh hour the Emperor would have been willing to leave him in
possession of the rest of the island, merely placing an Imperial garrison
in the new castle and insisting upon the regular payment of Benedetto’s
annuity. Martino, however, was in no mood for negotiations. He sank
the three galleys which he had in the harbour, forbade his Greek subjects
to wear arms under pain of death, and shut himself up with 800 men
behind the walls, from which there floated defiantly the flag of the
Zaccaria, instead of the customary Imperial standard. But, when he
saw that his brother had handed over a neighbouring fort to the
Emperor, and that no reliance could be placed upon his Greek subjects,
he sent messengers begging for peace. Andronikos repulsed them, saying
that the time for compromise was over, whereupon Martino surrendered.
The Chians clamoured for his execution; but Cantacuzene saved his life,
and he was conveyed a prisoner to Constantinople, while his wife
Jacqueline de la Roche, a connexion of the former ducal house of Athens,
was allowed to go free with her family and all that they could carry.
Martino’s adherents were given their choice of leaving the island with
their property, or of entering the Imperial service, and the majority
chose the latter alternative. The nationalist leaders were rewarded for
their devotion by gifts and honours; the people were relieved from their
oppressive public burdens. To Benedetto the Emperor offered the
governorship of Chios with half the net revenues of the island as his
salary—a generous offer which the Genoese rejected with scorn, asserting
that nothing short of absolute sovereignty over it would satisfy him.
If that were refused, he only asked for three galleys to carry him and his
property to Galata. Andronikos treated him with remarkable forbearance,
in order that public opinion might not accuse an Emperor of
having been guilty of meanness, and, on the proposal of Cantacuzene,
convened an assembly of Greeks and of the Latins who were then in the
island—Genoese and Venetian traders, the Duke of Naxos, the recently
appointed Roman Catholic bishop of Chios and some other Frères
Prêcheurs who had arrived—in order that there might be impartial
witnesses of his generosity. Even those of Benedetto’s own race and
creed regarded his obstinate refusal of the Imperial offer with disapprobation;
nor would he even accept a palace and the rank of Senator
at Constantinople with 20,000 gold pieces a year out of the revenues of
Chios; nothing but his three galleys could he be persuaded to take. His
object was soon apparent. Upon his arrival at Galata, he chartered
eight Genoese galleys, which he found lying there, and set out to reconquer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
Chios—a task which he considered likely to be easy, as the
Imperial fleet had by that time dispersed. The Chians, however, repulsed
his men with considerable loss, the survivors weighed anchor on the
morrow, and Benedetto II succumbed barely a week later to an attack
of apoplexy, brought on by his rage and disappointment<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>.</p>

<p>Martino, after eight years in captivity, was released by the intervention
of Pope Benedict XII and Philip VI of France in 1337, and
treated with favour by the Emperor, who “gave him a command in the
army and other castles,” as some compensation for his losses<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. In 1343,
Clement VI appointed him captain of the four papal galleys which
formed part of the crusade for the capture of the former Genoese colony
of Smyrna from Omar Beg of Aïdin, the self-styled “Prince of the
Morea<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>”—a post for which his special experience and local knowledge
were a particular recommendation in the eyes of the Pope. Martino
desired, however, to avail himself of this opportunity to reconquer
Chios from the Greeks, and invited the Knights and the Cypriote
detachment to join him in this venture, to which his friend, the Archbishop
of Thebes, endeavoured to force the latter by threats of
excommunication. The Pope saw, however, that this repetition on a
smaller scale of the selfish policy of the Fourth Crusade would have the
effect of alienating his Greek allies, and ordered the Latin Patriarch of
Constantinople to forbid the attack<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>. Martino lived to see Smyrna taken
in December, 1344, but on January 17, 1345, the rashness of the
Patriarch, who insisted on holding mass in the old Metropolitan Church
against the advice of the naval authorities, cost him his life. Omar
assaulted the cathedral while service was still going on, Martino was
slain, and his head presented to that redoubtable chieftain<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>. When, in
the following year, the Genoese retook Chios, and founded their second
long domination over it, his descendants did not profit by the conquest.
But his second son, Centurione, retained his baronies in the Morea, of
which the latter’s grandson and namesake was the last reigning Prince.</p>

<p>After the restoration of Greek rule in Chios and the appointment of
Kalothetos as Imperial viceroy, Andronikos III had proceeded to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
Phocæa. By this time the Genoese had abandoned the old city and had
strongly fortified themselves in the new town, purchasing further
security for their commercial operations by the payment of an annual
tribute of 15,000 pieces of silver and a personal present of 10,000 more
to Saru-Khan, the Turkish ruler of the district. The Emperor, having
placated this personage with the usual Oriental arguments, set out for
Foglia Nuova. Andriolo Cattaneo chanced to be absent at Genoa on
business, and the Genoese garrison of 52 knights and 400 foot-soldiers
was under the command of his uncle, Arrigo Tartaro. The latter wisely
averted annexation by doing homage to the Emperor, and handed the
keys of the newly constructed castle to his Varangian guard. After
spending two nights in the fortress, in order to show that it was his,
Andronikos magnanimously renewed the grant of the place to Andriolo
during good pleasure. But Domenico Cattaneo, who succeeded his
father not long afterwards with the assent of the Emperor, lost, in his
attempt to obtain more, what he already had.</p>

<p>Cattaneo, not content with the riches of Foglia Nuova, coveted the
island of Lesbos, which had belonged for just over a century to the
Greeks, and it seemed in 1333 as if an opportunity of seizing it had
arisen. The increasing power of the Turks, who had by that time taken
Nicæa and Brusa and greatly hindered Greek and Latin trade alike in
the Ægean, led to a coalition against them; but, before attacking the
common enemy, the Knights, Nicolò I of Naxos, and Cattaneo made a
treacherous descent upon Lesbos, and seized the capital of the island.
The crafty Genoese, supported by a number of galleys from his native
city, managed, however, to outwit his weaker allies, and ousted them
from all share in the conquered town, whither he transferred his residence
from Foglia Nuova. Andronikos, after punishing the Genoese of Pera
for this act of treachery on the part of their countrymen, set out to
recover Lesbos. The slowness of the Emperor’s movements, however,
enabled Cattaneo to strengthen the garrison, and Andronikos, leaving
one of his officers to besiege Lesbos, proceeded to invest Foglia with the
aid of Saru-Khan, whose son with other young Turks had been captured
and kept as a hostage by the Genoese garrison. The place, however,
continued for long to resist the attacks of the allies, till at last Cattaneo’s
lieutenant prevailed upon them to raise the siege by restoring the
prisoners to their parents and pledging himself to obtain the surrender
of the city of Mytilene, which still held out, and which the Emperor,
fearing troubles at home, had no time to take. Cattaneo, indeed, repudiated
this part of the arrangement, and bribery was needed to seduce
the Latin mercenaries and thus leave him unsupported. From Lesbos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
he retired to Foglia, which the Emperor had consented to allow him to
keep on the old terms; but four years later, while he was absent on a
hunting party, the Greek inhabitants overpowered the small Italian
garrison and proclaimed Andronikos III<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>. Thus ended the first Genoese
occupation of Phocæa and Lesbos—the harbinger of the much longer and
more durable colonisation a few years later. Two gold coins, modelled
on the Venetian ducats, of which the first of them is the earliest known
counterfeit, have survived to preserve the memory of Andriolo and
Domenico Cattaneo, and to testify to the riches of the Foglie under their
rule<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="heading20">2. THE GENOESE IN CHIOS (1346-1566)</h3>

<p>Of the Latin states which existed in Greek lands between the Latin
conquest of Constantinople in 1204 and the fall of the Venetian Republic
in 1797, there were four principal forms. Those states were either
independent kingdoms, such as Cyprus; feudal principalities, of which
that of Achaia is the best example; military outposts, like Rhodes; or
colonies directly governed by the mother-country, of which Crete was
the most conspicuous. But the Genoese administration of Chios differed
from all the other Latin creations in the Levant. It was what we
should call in modern parlance a Chartered Company, which on a
smaller scale anticipated the career of the East India and the British
South Africa Companies in our own history.</p>

<p>The origins of the Latin colonization of Greece are usually to be
found in places and circumstances where we should least expect to find
them. The incident which led to this Genoese occupation of the most
fertile island of the Ægean is to be sought in the history of the smallest
of European principalities—that of Monaco, which in the first half of
the fourteenth century already belonged to the noble Genoese family of
Grimaldi, which still reigns over it. At that time the rock of Monaco
and the picturesque village of Roquebrune (between Monte Carlo and
Mentone) sheltered a number of Genoese nobles, fugitives from their
native city, where one of those revolutions common in the mediæval
republics of Italy had placed the popular party in power. The proximity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
and the preparations of these exiles were a menace to Genoa, but the
resources of the republican treasury were too much exhausted to equip
a fleet against them at the cost of the state. Accordingly, an appeal was
made to the patriotism of private citizens, whose expenses were to be
ultimately refunded, and in the meanwhile guaranteed by the possession
of any conquered territory. In response to this appeal, twenty-six
of the people and three nobles of the popular party equipped that
number of galleys, which were placed under the command of Simone
Vignoso, himself one of the twenty-nine privateers. On April 24, 1346,
the fleet set sail; and, at its approach, the outlawed nobles fled to
Marseilles, whence many of them entered the French army and died
four months later fighting at Crécy against our King Edward III.</p>

<p>The immediate object for which the fleet had been fitted out had
been thus accomplished. But it seemed to Vignoso a pity that it should
not be employed, and the Near East offered a tempting field for its
activities. The condition of south-eastern Europe in 1346 might perhaps
be paralleled with its situation in later times. An ancient empire,
which Gladstone described as “more wonderful than anything done by
the Romans,” enthroned on the Bosporos with one brief interval for ten
centuries, was obviously crumbling away, and its ultimate dissolution
was only a question of time. A lad of fourteen, John V Palaiologos, sat
on the throne of the Cæsars, while a woman and a foreigner, the Empress-mother
Anne of Savoy, governed in his name. Against her and her son
the too-powerful Grand Domestic (or, as we should say, prime minister),
John Cantacuzene, whom posterity remembers rather as an historian
than as an Emperor, had raised the standard of revolt. In Asia Minor
Byzantium retained nothing but the suburb of Scutari, Philadelphia,
and the two towns of Phocæa. Independent emirs ruled the south and
centre, the Ottomans the north, whence in seven years they were to
cross into Europe, in eight more to transfer their capital to Adrianople.
Already the European provinces of Byzantium were cut short by the
frontier of the Bulgarian Empire and still more by the rapid advance of
Serbia, then the most powerful state in the Balkan peninsula. Seventeen
days before Vignoso sailed for the East, the great Serbian conqueror and
lawgiver, Stephen Dushan, one of the most remarkable figures in mediæval
history, was crowned at Skoplje “Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks”
and had proposed to Genoa’s rival, Venice, an alliance for the conquest
of the Byzantine Empire. Greece proper, with the exception of the
Byzantine province in the Morea, was parcelled out between Latin
rulers, while Byzantium had no fleet to protect her outlying territories.
Under these circumstances a commercial Italian republic might not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
unnaturally seek to peg out claims in the midst of the general confusion
in the East, where only two years before Smyrna, formerly a Genoese
colony, had been recaptured from the Turks.</p>

<p>Vignoso’s first intention was to protect the Genoese settlements on
the Black Sea against the attacks of the Tartars; but information
received at Negroponte, where he touched on the way, led him to change
his plans. There he found a fleet of Venetian and Rhodian galleys, under
the Dauphin of Vienne, preparing to occupy Chios as a naval base for
operations against the Turks in Asia Minor. Vignoso and his associates
were offered large sums for their co-operation, but their patriotism
rejected the idea of handing over to the rival republic an island which had
belonged to the Genoese family of Zaccaria from 1304 to 1329, and
which as recently as seventeen years earlier had been recovered by the
Greeks. They made all sail for Chios, and offered to assist the islanders
against a Venetian attack, if they would hoist the Genoese flag and
admit a small Genoese garrison. The scornful refusal of the garrison was
followed by the landing of the Genoese; four days sufficed to take the
rest of the island; but the citadel made such a spirited resistance that
three months passed before food gave out and on September 12 the
capitulation was signed. The governor, Kalojanni Cybo, himself of
Genoese extraction, and a member of the well-known Ligurian family
which afterwards produced Pope Innocent VIII, made excellent terms
for himself and his relatives, while the Greeks were to enjoy their
former religious liberties and endowments, their property, and their
privileges. A Genoese governor was to be appointed to administer the
island according to the laws of the Republic, and 200 houses in the citadel
were assigned at once for the use of the Genoese garrison. Vignoso
proved by his example that he meant to keep these promises. He
ordered his own son to be flogged publicly for stealing grapes from a
vineyard belonging to one of the natives, and bequeathed a sum of
money for providing poor Chiote girls with dowries as compensation for
any damage that he might have inflicted upon the islanders.</p>

<p>Vignoso completed the conquest of Chios by the annexation of Old
and New Phocæa, or Foglia Vecchia and Nuova, as the Italians called
them, almost the last Byzantine possessions on the coast of Asia Minor,
and celebrated for their valuable alum-mines, whence English ships used
to obtain materials for dyeing, and of the neighbouring islands of Psara,
or Santa Panagia, Samos, Ikaria, and the Œnoussai<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>. All these places<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
had belonged to the former Genoese lords of Chios, with whose fortunes
they were now reunited. The two Foglie, with the exception of a brief
Byzantine restoration, remained in Genoese hands till they were conquered
by the Turks in 1455; Foglia Vecchia, after about 1402, being
administered by the Gattilusj of Lesbos, Foglia Nuova being leased to
a member of the <i>maona</i> for life or a term of years. Samos and Psara
were abandoned in 1475 from fear of corsairs, and their inhabitants
removed to Chios, whilst the harbourless Ikaria, where pirates could not
land, was in 1362 granted to the Genoese family of Arangio, which held
it with the title of Count until 1481. In that year it was ceded for
greater security to the knights of Rhodes, and remained united with that
island till it too was conquered by the Turks in 1522. Vignoso desired
to add the rich island of Lesbos and the strategic island of Tenedos,
which, as we have been lately reminded, commands the mouth of the
Dardanelles, to his acquisitions. But his crews had had enough of
fighting, and were so mutinous that he returned to Genoa<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>.</p>

<p>The Genoese exchequer was unable to repay to Vignoso and his
partners their expenses, amounting to 203,000 Genoese pounds (£79,170
of our money) or 7000 for each of the twenty-nine galleys, the Genoese
pound being then, according to Desimoni, worth 9 lire 75 centesimi.
Accordingly, by an arrangement made on February 26, 1347, it was
agreed that the Republic should liquidate this liability within twenty
years and thereupon become the direct owner of the conquered places,
which in the meanwhile were to be governed—and the civil and criminal
administration conducted—in her name. The collection of taxes,
however, and the monopoly of the mastic, which was the chief product
of the island, were granted to the twenty-nine associates in the company,
or <i>mahona</i>, as it was called. The origin of this word is uncertain. In
modern Italian <i>maona</i> means a “lighter”; but those vessels of Turkish
invention are not mentioned before 1500. On the other hand, we read
of a <i>maona</i>, or <i>madona</i> (as it is there written), in connexion with a
Genoese expedition to Ceuta in a document of 1236, and it has, therefore,
been suggested that <i>maona</i> is a Ligurian contraction of <i>Madonna</i>,
and that such trading companies were under the protection of Our Lady,
whose image was to be seen on the palace of the Giustiniani at Genoa.
At any rate, the name was applied to other Genoese companies, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Old and New <i>maona</i> of Cyprus, founded in 1374 and 1403, and to the
<i>maona</i> of Corsica, founded in 1378. Other derivations are from the
Greek word μονάς (“unit”), the Genoese <i>mobba</i> (“union”), and the
Arabic <i>me-unet</i> (“subsidy”)<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>.</p>

<p>This convention with the <i>maonesi</i><a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> was to be valid only as long as
the popular party remained in power at Genoa. The Republic was to be
represented in Chios by a <i>podestà</i>, selected annually out of a list of twenty
Genoese democrats submitted in February by the Doge and his council
to the <i>maonesi</i>; from these twenty the <i>maonesi</i> were to choose four, and
one of these four was then appointed <i>podestà</i> by the Doge and council.
Should the first list of twenty be rejected by the <i>maonesi</i>, a second list
was to be prepared by the home government. The <i>podestà</i> was to swear
to govern according to the regulations of Genoa and the convention
concluded by Vignoso with the Greeks. Twice a year he went on circuit
through the island to hear the complaints of the natives, and no
<i>maonese</i> was allowed to accompany him on those journeys. Another
officer of the Republic was the <i>castellano</i>, or commander of the castle of
Chios, likewise chosen annually, from a list of six names, submitted to
the Duke and his council by the <i>maonesi</i>. This officer was bound to find
security to the amount of 3000 Genoese pounds (£1170) for his important
charge. A <i>podestà</i> and <i>castellano</i> for Foglia Nuova and the
<i>castellano</i> of Foglia Vecchia, who had the powers of a <i>podestà</i>, were
appointed in the same way. These officials were responsible for their
misdeeds to a board of examiners, and the <i>podestà</i> was assisted by six,
afterwards twelve, councillors called <i>gubernatores</i>, elected by the <i>maonesi</i>
or other nominees, in everything except his judicial work, where their
co-operation was at his discretion. Salaries were not high; those of the
<i>podestà</i> of Chios and Foglia Nuova were only 1250 (or £560) and 600
<i>hypérpera</i> (or £268 16<i>s.</i>) respectively; those of the three <i>castellani</i>
ranged from 400 to 500 (or £179 4<i>s.</i> to £224). Out of these sums they
had to keep and clothe a considerable retinue. Local officials called
generically <i>rettori</i>, but familiarly known as <i>codespótæ</i> (“joint lords”) or
<i>protogérontes</i> (“chief elders”) in the eight northern, and as <i>logariastaí</i>
(or “calculators”) in the four southern or mastic districts of Chios, were
appointed by the <i>podestà</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>podestà</i> had the right of coining money, provided that his coins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
bore the effigy of the Doge of Genoa and the inscription “Dux Ianuensium
Conradus Rex” in memory of Conrad III, King of the Romans,
who in 1138 had conceded to the Republic the privilege of a mint on
condition that her coins always bore his name<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>. This condition was not,
however, always observed in the Chiote mint. The <i>maonesi</i> between
1382 and 1415 coined base imitations of the Venetian <i>zecchini</i>, a practice
likewise adopted by Francesco I Gattilusio of Lesbos, and by Stephen
Urosh II of Servia, and which procured for the latter a place among the
evil kings in the <i>Paradiso</i><a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> of Dante. From 1415 the name and figure of
St Laurence, the patron saint of the cathedral at Genoa, and the initial
or name of the Doge began to appear on the Chiote coins; during the
Milanese domination of Genoa two Dukes of Milan, Filippo Maria
Visconti and Galeazzo Maria Sforza, figured on the currency of the
island, and two issued during the French protectorate of Genoa (1458-61)
actually bear the kneeling figure of Charles VII<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>. Finally, from 1483
small pieces bear the initials of the <i>podestà</i>. The financial affairs of the
company were entrusted to two officials known as <i>massarj</i>, who were
obliged to send in annual accounts to the Genoese Audit Office. Lastly,
Chios was to be a free port for Genoese ships, which were to stop a day
there on the voyage to Greece or between Greece and Syria, but no
Genoese outlaws were to be harboured there. Thus, while the nominal
suzerainty was vested in the home government, the real usufruct
belonged to the company, especially as the former was never able to
clear off its liabilities to the latter.</p>

<p>The members of the <i>maona</i> soon began to tire of their bargain and
to sell their shares. Vignoso died, most of his partners resided at Genoa,
and only eleven years after the constitution of the original company the
island was in the possession of eight associates, of whom one alone,
Lanfranco Drizzacorne, had been a member of the old <i>maona</i>. These
persons, being mainly absentees, had farmed out the revenues to another
company, formed in 1349 for the extraction of mastic, and consisting of
twelve individuals under the direction of Pasquale Forneto and Giovanni
Oliverio. Difficulties arose between the eight partners and their lessees;
the Republic intervened, and, by the good offices of the Doge of Genoa,
Simone Boccanegra, a fresh arrangement<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> was made on March 8, 1362.
The island was farmed out for twelve years to the twelve persons above
mentioned or their heirs, who collectively formed an “inn” (or <i>albergo</i>),
and, abandoning their family names, called themselves both collectively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
and individually the Giustiniani—a name assumed three years earlier
by the members of the old <i>maona</i>, and perhaps derived from the palace
where their office was. One of the twelve partners, Gabriele Adorno,
alone declined to merge that illustrious name in a common designation.
The members of this new <i>maona</i> were to enjoy the revenues of the island
in equal shares; but the Republic reserved to herself the right of purchasing
Chios before February 26, 1367, the date fixed by the previous
arrangement for the liquidation of her original debt of 203,000 Genoese
pounds; if that date were allowed to pass without such payment, the
Republic could not exercise the right of purchase for three years more;
if no payment were made by February 26, 1374, that right would be
forfeited altogether. No member of the new company could sell his
twelfth or any fraction of it (for each twelfth was divided into three parts
called <i>caratti grossi</i> and each of these three was subsequently subdivided
into eight shares, making 288 <i>caratti piccoli</i> in all) to any of his partners,
but, with the consent of the Doge, he might substitute a fresh partner
in his place, provided always that the number of the partners remained
twelve and that they belonged to the popular party at Genoa. The
number was not, however, strictly maintained. Thus, while at first the
partners were twelve, viz. Nicolò de Caneto, Giovanni Campi, Francesco
Arangio, Nicolò di S. Teodoro, Gabriele Adorno, Paolo Banca, Tommaso
Longo, Andriolo Campi, Raffaelle di Forneto, Lucchino Negro, Pietro
Oliverio, and Francesco Garibaldi, there was soon added a thirteenth in
the person of Pietro di S. Teodoro, whose share, however, only consisted
of two <i>caratti grossi</i>, or sixteen <i>caratti piccoli</i>, that is to say, two-thirds
of the share of each of the other members. In the very next year
some of the partners retired to Genoa, selling their shares, and thus two
entire twelfths came into the possession of the same individual, Pietro
Recanelli, who had succeeded Vignoso as the leading spirit of the
company. Later on, the shares became subdivided to such an extent
that at the date of the Turkish conquest more than 600 persons held
fractions of them. The shareholders were entitled not only to their
dividends but also to a proportionate share of the local offices, of which
two or three were attached to each share, but no shareholder could hold
the more important for two consecutive years.</p>

<p>When the term for the purchase of the island by the Genoese
Republic drew near, her treasury, exhausted by the war arising out of her
quarrels with the Venetians in Cyprus, was unable to liquidate its debt
to the company of 203,000 Genoese pounds, at that time (owing to the
change in the value of the pound) equivalent to 152,250. Anxious not
to forfeit her right of purchase, the Republic paid to the company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
collectively this sum, which she had first borrowed from the chief
members of it in their individual capacity as bankers. By this financial
juggle she became possessed of Chios; but, in order to pay the interest
on her new loan, she let the island for twenty years more to the <i>maonesi</i>,
who were to deduct from its revenues the amount of the interest and
remit the balance, calculated at 2000 gold florins, to the Genoese exchequer.
Seven years’ balance was to be paid in advance. But such was
the financial distress of Genoa that the government in 1380 was obliged
to mortgage this annual balance to the bank of St George for 100,000
Genoese pounds. The company then came to the aid of the mother-country,
and voluntarily offered to furnish a loan of 25,000 Genoese
pounds. In return, the Republic, by a convention of June 28, 1385,
renewed the lease of Chios, which would otherwise have expired in 1394,
till 1418. Five years before the latter date it was again renewed, in
return for a fresh loan of 18,000 Genoese pounds, till 1447; again, in
1436, in consideration of a further loan of 25,000, it was prolonged till
1476, when it was extended to 1507 and then till 1509. Then, at last,
the Republic not only resolved to pay off the <i>maonesi</i>, but even raised
the money for the purpose; but the shareholders protested that 152,250
Genoese pounds were no longer sufficient in view of the altered value of
the pound (then worth only 3 lire 73 c.) and the large sums which they
had advanced. Payment was accordingly postponed till 1513, when it
was decided to leave the island in the hands of the Giustiniani till 1542,
with some modifications of their charter. In 1528, however, it was
finally agreed to lease Chios to them in perpetuity, in return for an
annual rent of 2500 Genoese pounds. At that time most of the shareholders
were enrolled in the Golden Book of Genoa.</p>

<p>Such were the arrangements between the company and the mother-country,
arrangements which worked so well that in 220 years there
was only one revolt against her, when Marshal Boucicault occupied
Genoa for the King of France. Considering their contract thereby
annulled, the Giustiniani deposed the <i>podestà</i> and on December 21, 1408,
proclaimed their independence. Venice allowed them to buy provisions
and arms; but in June, 1409, a Genoese force under Corrado Doria forced
them to yield<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>. Let us now look at their relations with foreign powers.
Of these, three were at one time or another a menace to their existence—the
Greek Empire, Venice, and the Turks. Both Anne of Savoy<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> and
Cantacuzene demanded the restoration of Chios from the Republic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
which replied that no official orders had been given for its capture and
the government could assume no responsibility for the acts of a private
company, nor could it dislodge the latter without great expense; at
some future date, however, when circumstances were more favourable,
it would undoubtedly be possible to restore it to the Emperor. The latter
was not satisfied with this reply, but bade the Genoese envoys, who were
sent to pacify him, fix a definite date for the evacuation of Chios. It was
then agreed between him and the Republic that the <i>maonesi</i> should retain
the city of Chios, and enjoy its revenues, for ten years, on condition that
they paid an annual tribute of 12,000 gold pieces to the Emperor,
hoisted his flag, mentioned his name in their public prayers, and
received their metropolitan from the church of Constantinople. The
rest of the island, including the other forts, was to belong to the
Emperor, and to be governed by an Imperial official, who was to decide
all disputes between the Greeks, while those between a Greek and a
Latin were to be referred to the two Byzantine and Genoese authorities
sitting together. At the end of the ten years, calculated from Cantacuzene’s
occupation of Constantinople, the Genoese were to evacuate
Chios altogether. Vignoso and his co-partners, however, declined to be
bound by an arrangement made between the Emperor and the Republic,
whereupon Cybo attempted to restore Greek rule, and perished in the
attempt. The two Foglie were, however, temporarily reoccupied<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>, but
the Greek peril ceased when the Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1363
granted Chios to Pietro Recanelli and his colleagues in return for an
annual payment of 500 <i>hypérpera</i> (or £224)<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>. Eight years earlier the
position of the <i>maona</i> had been strengthened by the same Emperor’s gift
of Lesbos as his sister’s dowry to another Genoese, Francesco Gattilusio,
whose family, as time went on, ruled also over Thasos, Lemnos, Samothrace,
Imbros, and the town of Ænos on the mainland, in 1913 the
Turkish frontier in Europe. In 1440 John VI renewed the charter of 1363.</p>

<p>Venice was a more obstinate rival. The war which broke out between
the two Republics in 1350 involved Chios, for a defeated Genoese
squadron took refuge there. But Vignoso, with his usual energy, fitted
out a flotilla, sailed to Negroponte, captured the castle of Karystos,
ravaged Keos, and hung the keys of Chalkis as a trophy over the castle-gate
of Chios—a humiliation avenged by the despatch of a Venetian
squadron which carried off many of the islanders<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>. During the struggle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
of the two Italian commonwealths for the possession of Tenedos
(granted to Genoa by Andronikos IV in 1376), Foglia Vecchia was
attacked and the suburbs of Chios laid in ashes. For a time the common
danger from the Turks united the Venetians and the Genoese company;
but in 1431-2 a Venetian fleet bombarded the town. The captain of the
Venetian foot-soldiers, who bore the appropriate name of Scaramuccia,
was killed while laying a mine, and the admiral, Mocenigo, contented
himself with ravaging the mastic-gardens. On his return home he was
condemned to ten months’ imprisonment in the <i>Pozzi</i>, while his Genoese
rival, Spinola, carried off the keys of Karystos to adorn the castle of
Chios, where they were still visible in the sixteenth century<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.</p>

<p>There remained the most serious of all enemies—the Turks. Murad I,
who died in 1389, had already levied tribute from Chios<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>; Mohammed I
in 1415 fixed this sum at 4000 gold ducats, while the lessee of Foglia
Nuova paid 20,000 out of the profits of the alum mines. By this system
of Danegeld the <i>maonesi</i> kept on fairly good terms with the Turks till
the capture of Constantinople. The active part taken in its defence by
one of the Giustiniani, whose name will ever be connected with that of
the heroic Constantine XI, exasperated Mohammed II against Chios,
whither the chalices and furniture from the Genoese churches of Pera
were removed, and many of the survivors fled for safety. An increase of
the tribute to 6000 ducats was accepted<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. But in 1455 the Turks sent
two fleets to Chios under the pretext of collecting a debt for alum,
alleged to have been supplied to the <i>maona</i> by Francesco Drapperio,
former lessee of Foglia Nuova, and then established at Pera<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>. These
expeditions cost the company Foglia Nuova, but it gained a further
respite by the payment of a lump sum of 30,000 gold pieces and the
increase of the annual tribute to 10,000 ducats. In vain it appealed to
Genoa and to the Pope; in vain on April 7, 1456, the Republic wrote to
our King Henry VI<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>, then struggling against the Yorkists, for assistance,
reminding him that there had been few wars against the infidels in which
the most Christian Kings of England had not borne a great part of the toils
and dangers. The extinction of the Lesbian principality of the Gattilusj
in 1462, the taking of Caffa in 1475, the capture of the Venetian colony
of Negroponte by the Turks in 1479, were signs of what was in store for
Chios, now completely isolated. The <i>maonesi</i> in vain wrote to Genoa,
threatening to abandon the island, if help were not forthcoming, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
offered to cede it to her altogether. “We cannot put our hands,” so ran
their letter, “on 100 ducats; we owe 10,000. The Genoese mercenaries
sent us were very bad. Send us none from the district between Rapallo
and Voltri, for they quarrel daily, steal by day and night, and pay too
much attention to the Greek ladies,” whose charms were the theme of
every visitor to the island<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. The only means of maintaining independence
was to pay tribute punctually and to propitiate any persons
who might be influential at the Porte, notably the French ambassadors,
two of whom visited Chios in 1537 and 1550. Finally, in 1558
Genoa disavowed all connexion with the island, and instructed her
representative at Constantinople to repudiate her sovereignty over
it<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.</p>

<p>Then came the final catastrophe. The company was no longer able
to provide the annual tribute, which had risen to 14,000 gold pieces, and
to give the usual presents, valued at 2000 ducats, of scarlet cloth to the
Turkish viziers, “a race of men full of rapacity and avarice,” as De
Thou called them. It was accused of having betrayed the Turkish plans
against Malta to the knights and thus helping to stultify the siege of
that island in 1565; while the fugitive slaves who found refuge in Chios
were a constant source of difficulties. One of them was the property
of the grand vizier; the <i>podestà</i>, Vincenzo Giustiniani, called upon either
to give him up or pay compensation, confided the latter to an emissary,
who absconded with the money. Thereupon Pialì Pasha, a Hungarian
renegade in the Turkish service, appeared off Chios with a fleet of from
80 to 300 sail on Easter Monday, April 15, 1566. The pasha told the
Chiotes that he would not land, as he did not wish to disturb the Easter
ceremonies. Next day he entered the harbour and demanded the
tribute. After having landed and studied the strategic position, he
invited the <i>podestà</i> and the twelve “governors” on board to confer with
him, and clapped them into irons. On April 17, as an inscription<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> in the
chief mosque, then a church, still tells us, he took the town, and the
flag of St George with the red cross gave way to the crescent almost
without resistance.</p>

<p>The fall of Genoese rule was ennobled by the heroism of the bishop,
Timoteo Giustiniani, who bade a renegade kill him rather than profane
the mass, and by the martyrdom of eighteen boys, who died rather than
embrace Islâm—a scene depicted by Carlone in the chapel of the Ducal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
Palace at Genoa<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>. The other boys between the ages of twelve and
sixteen were enrolled in the corps of janissaries, while the leading <i>maonesi</i>
were exiled to Caffa, whence some of them, thanks to the intervention
of the French ambassador, returned to Chios or Genoa<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>. In vain they
demanded from the home government compensation for the loss of their
island. As late as 1805 their descendants were still trying to recover a
sum of money, deposited with the bank of St George, and in 1815 the
bank ceased to exist and with it the last faint hope of repayment.
There were, however, some lucky exceptions to these misfortunes. Thus
Vincenzo Negri Giustiniani, who was a child of two at the date of the
Turkish conquest, came to Rome, was created by Pope Paul V in 1605
first marquess of Bassano, and in 1610 built the Palazzo Giustiniani,
now the seat of the Italian Freemasons and of the Prussian Historical
Institute. Professor Kehr, the director of that body, informs me, however,
that there is no trace there of the Chiote inscription of 1522, which
is said to have been removed thither<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>. On the other hand, although the
Turks destroyed many churches, Chios still abounds with Latin monuments<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>,
in which the arms of the Giustiniani—a castle of three towers,
surmounted after 1413 by the imperial eagle granted by the Emperor
Sigismund<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>—are conspicuous. It may be of interest to mention that
when in 1912, an Italian attack upon Chios was contemplated, orders
were issued to spare the historical monuments of Chios. That island,
however, with the exception of a brief Venetian occupation in 1694-5,
remained Turkish till November 24, 1912, when a Greek force landed and
on the following day easily captured the capital, which thus, for the
first time since 1346, passed from under foreign domination.</p>

<p>We may now ask ourselves whether the rule of the company was
successful. Financially, it certainly was. Even in its latter days, when
heavy loans had been contracted with the bank of St George and the
Turkish tribute was 14,000 gold ducats, a dividend of 2000 ducats was
paid on each of the thirteen original shares; while in its best times the
small <i>caratto</i>, originally worth some 30 Genoese pounds, was quoted at
4930. Chios during the middle ages was one of the most frequented
marts of the Levant, while the alum of Foglia Nuova (which, as long as
that factory remained Genoese, covered the annual rent to Genoa) and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
the mastic of the island (in which a part of the Turkish tribute was paid)
were two valuable sources of revenue. The production of mastic was
carefully organised. The company leased to each hamlet a certain area
of plantation, and the lessees once a year handed in a certain weight of
mastic in proportion to the number of the trees. If it were a good year
and the yield were greater, they received a fixed price per pound for the
excess quantity delivered; but if they failed to deliver the stipulated
amount, they had to pay twice that sum<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>. In order to keep up prices
in years of over-production, all the mastic over a certain amount was
either warehoused or burned. Special officials divided the net profit
accruing from its sale among the shareholders; no private person might
sell it to foreigners; and thefts or smuggling of the precious gum, if
committed on a small scale, cost the delinquent an ear, his nose, or both;
if on a large scale, brought him to the gallows. Another curious source
of revenue was the tax on widows<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. The latter must have had ample
opportunities of avoiding the penalty, for the courtesy and beauty of the
Chiote ladies was the theme of every traveller. Indeed, one impressionable
Frenchman<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> proclaimed Chios to be “the most agreeable residence”
with which he was acquainted, while another visitor<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> declared their
natural charm, the elegance of their attire, and the attraction of their
gestures and conversation to be such “that they might rather be judged
to be nymphs or goddesses than mortal women or maids.” He then,
greatly daring, attempts a detailed description of their costume, upon
which I shall not venture. Nor were amusements lacking. The inhabitants
were musical; they were wont to dance by the Skaramangkou
torrent; the chief religious feasts were kept in state; and Cyriacus of
Ancona<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> was a witness of the festivities which accompanied the carnival
in what Bartolomeo dalli Sonetti<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>, another traveller of the fifteenth
century, called the first island of the Archipelago.</p>

<p>There was more intellectual life at Chios than in some of the Latin
settlements in the Levant; indeed, the two Genoese colonies of Chios and
Lesbos stood higher in that respect than most of the Venetian factories.
The list of authors during the period of the <i>maona</i> is considerable.
Among them we may specially notice Leonardo Giustiniani, archbishop
of Lesbos, but a native of Chios, and author of a curious treatise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
<i>De vera nobilitate</i>, intended as a reply to the book <i>De nobilitate</i> of the
celebrated scholar, Poggio Bracciolini. But the chief value of the
literary divine for us at the present day is the graphic account which he
has left us in two letters, addressed respectively to Popes Nicholas V and
Pius II, of the Turkish conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and of
Lesbos in 1462—accounts of the greatest historical interest, because their
author was an eyewitness of what he described. In Gerolamo Garibaldi
Giustiniani, born in Chios in 1544, the island found an historian, who
wrote in French a work entitled <i>La Description et Histoire de l’Isle de
Scios, ou Chios</i>; Vincenzo Banca Giustiniani, another Latin Chiote,
edited the works of St Thomas Aquinas; while Alessandro Rocca Giustiniani
translated portions of Aristotle and Hippocrates. But the most
curious local literary figure of the period was Andriolo Banca Giustiniani
(1385-1456), who sang in Italian verse the Venetian siege of Chios<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> of
1431. The poet was a man of taste and had the means to satisfy it; he
constructed near the so-called “School of Homer” (who, according to
Thucydides, was a native of Chios) an “Homeric villa” in a forest of
pines near a crystal well, where he was visited by the well-known
antiquary and traveller, Cyriacus of Ancona, his frequent correspondent<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>.
This elegant Chiote accumulated a library of 2000 manuscripts,
and for him Ambrogio Traversari of Florence translated into Latin the
treatise on the Immortality of the Soul by the fifth-century philosopher,
Æneas of Gaza. His son, in 1474, entertained at his villa a greater even
than the archæologist of Ancona, then, however, only a modest ship’s
captain, the future discoverer of America, Christopher Columbus. The
culture, however, of the Giustiniani seems to have been mainly Latin—a
fact explained by their practice of sending their sons to be educated
at Genoa, Pavia, Padua, or Bologna; and it was from Italy that they
summoned the architects to build their palaces “of divers kinds of
marbles, with great porticoes and magnificent galleries,” and their
villas, of which there were more than 100 in the last century of their rule.
It was only just before the Turkish conquest that they thought of founding
a university<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>.</p>

<p>But we must also look at the picture from another point of view—that
of the governed. The judgment of Finlay that the rule of the
company was “the least oppressive government in the Levant” seems
by the light of later research to need qualification. If we are to take as
our standard the happiness of the people as a whole, then of all the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
establishments in the Levant Lesbos comes first. But for that there
were special reasons. The first Gattilusio came to Lesbos not as a foreign
conqueror, but as brother-in-law of the Greek Emperor; he soon spoke
the language of his subjects; his successors wrote in Greek, and as time
went on the family became hellenized. But a company is apt to be
deficient on the human side; and this would seem to have been the weak
point of the <i>maona</i>. Quite early in its career a conspiracy of the Greeks
was discovered, which led to the permanent expulsion of the metropolitan
and the substitution in his place of a vicar, called Δίκαιος (or
“the Just”), elected by the company and confirmed by the patriarch.
Moreover, the dominant church, whose bishops were usually Pallavicini
or Giustiniani, was partly supported by tithes, which the members
of the other creed had also to pay, and which they paid so reluctantly
that in 1480 the bishop was glad to abandon all claims to tithe and all
the church property to the company<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> in return for a fixed stipend.
Moreover, we are told that certain Latins seized property belonging
to Νέα Μονή, “one of the most beautiful churches of the Archipelago,”
as it was called<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>. To these ecclesiastical disadvantages was
added social inferiority. The native nobles, or <i>archontes</i>, sixty in number,
although their privileges had been guaranteed at the conquest and
although instructions were subsequently given to see that that pledge
was respected, ranked not only below the Giustiniani, who formed the
apex of the social scale, but below the Genoese <i>bourgeoisie</i> also, from
which they suffered most. They lived apart in the old town (much as
the Catholics still do at Syra); and if they sold their property and left
the island, they forfeited to the company one-quarter of the proceeds of
such sale.</p>

<p>Worse still was the position of the Greek peasantry, who were
practically serfs, forbidden to emigrate without permission and passports.
Liable to perform military service even out of the island, they
had to undertake in time of peace various forced labours, of which the
lightest was to act as beaters once a year for their masters during the
partridge season. So many of them sought to escape from Chios that a
local shibboleth was invented for their identification, and they were
obliged to pronounce the word <i>fragela</i> (a sort of white bread), which
became <i>frangela</i> in the mouth of a native. Still, the Greeks were consulted
at least formally before a new tax was imposed; a Greek noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
sat in the commercial court and on the commission of public works, and
during the administration of Marshal Boucicault in 1409 and down to
1417 four out of the six councillors who assisted the <i>podestà</i> were Greeks.
In later times when there was a Turkish element in the population—for
after 1484 the Turks paid no dues—the company provided the salary
of the Turkish <i>kâdi</i>. Cases were tried in a palace known as the Δικαιότατο
(“Most Just”), and a “column of justice” hard by served for the
punishment of the guilty. A great hardship was the cost of appeals to
the ducal council in Genoa—the counterpart of our judicial committee
of the privy council. Worst treated of all classes were the Jews, forced to
wear a yellow bonnet, to live in their ghetto, which was hermetically
closed at Easter, to present a white banner with the red cross of St
George to the <i>podestà</i> once a year, and to make sport for the Genoese
at religious festivals<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>. Such, briefly, was the Genoese administration of
Chios—an episode which may serve to remind us how very modern in
some ways were the methods of Italian mediæval commonwealths.</p>

<p>The Genoese occupation of Chios, Lesbos, and Phocæa by the
families of Zaccaria and Cattaneo was not forgotten in the counting-houses
of the Ligurian Republic. In 1346, two years after the capture
of Smyrna, Chios once more passed under Genoese control, the two
Foglie followed suit, and in 1355 the strife between John Cantacuzene
and John V Palaiologos for the throne of Byzantium enabled a daring
Genoese, Francesco Gattilusio, to found a dynasty in Lesbos, which
gradually extended its branches to the islands of the Thracian sea and
to the city of Ænos on the opposite mainland, and which lasted in the
original seat for more than a century.</p>

<p>Disappointed in a previous attempt to recover his rights, the young
Emperor John V was at this time living in retirement on the island of
Tenedos, then a portion of the Greek Empire and from its position at
the mouth of the Dardanelles both an excellent post of observation and
a good base for a descent upon Constantinople. During his sojourn
there, a couple of Genoese galleys arrived, commanded by Francesco
Gattilusio, a wealthy freebooter, who had sailed from his native city<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
to carve out for himself, amidst the confusion of the Orient, a petty
principality in the Thracian Chersonese, as others of his compatriots
had twice done in Chios, as the Venetian nobles had done in the Archipelago
150 years earlier. The Emperor found in this chance visitor an
instrument to effect his own restoration; the two men came to terms,
and John V promised, that if Gattilusio would help him to recover his
throne, he would bestow upon him the hand of his sister Maria—an
honour similar to that conferred by Michael VIII upon Benedetto
Zaccaria.</p>

<p>The family of Gattilusio, which thus entered the charmed circle of
Byzantine royalty, had already for two centuries occupied a prominent
position at Genoa. One of the name is mentioned as a member of the
Great Council in 1157; a second is found holding civic office in 1212 and
1214; and two others were signatories of the treaty of Nymphæum.
Luchetto, grandfather of the first lord of Lesbos, was both a troubadour
and a man of affairs, who went as envoy to Pope Boniface VIII to
negotiate peace between his native city and Venice, served as <i>podestà</i>
of Bologna, Milan, Savona, and Cremona; and founded in 1295 the
family church of San Giacomo at Sestri Ponente in memory of his father—a
foundation which remained in the possession of the Gattilusj till
1483, and of which the Lesbian branch continued to be patron. Towards
the end of the thirteenth century, the family seems to have turned its
attention to the Levant trade, for a Gattilusio was among the Genoese
who had sustained damage from the subjects of the Greek Emperor at
that period, and by 1341 another member of the clan was a resident at
Pera. In that year Oberto Gattilusio was one of the Genoese ambassadors,
who concluded the treaty between the Republic and the Regent
Anne of Savoy at Constantinople, and ten years later the same personage
was sent on an important mission to all the Genoese commercial settlements
in the East. The future ruler of Lesbos was this man’s nephew<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.</p>

<p>The Genoese of Galata had good reasons to be dissatisfied with the
commercial and naval policy of Cantacuzene, and it was no less their
interest than that of their ambitious fellow-countryman to see John V
replaced on the throne of his ancestors. They accordingly entered into
negotiations with him at Tenedos, and thus Gattilusio could rely upon
the co-operation of his compatriots at the capital. On a dark and windy
night in the late autumn of 1354 he arrived with the young Emperor
off the “postern of the Pathfinding Virgin,” where his Ligurian mother-wit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
at once suggested a device for obtaining admittance. He had on
board a number of oil-jars, which he had brought full from Italy—for
he combined business with politics—but which were by this time empty.
These he ordered the sailors to hurl against the walls one at a time,
until the noise awoke the sleeping sentinels. To the summons of the
latter voices shouted from the galleys, that they were merchantmen
with a cargo of oil, that one of their ships had been wrecked, and that
they were willing to share the remains of the cargo with anyone who
would help them in their present distress. At this appeal to their love
of gain the guards opened the gate, whereupon some 500 of the conspirators
entered, slew the sentries on the adjoining tower, and were
speedily reinforced by the rest of the ships’ crews and marines.
Francesco, who was throughout the soul of the undertaking, mounted
a tower in which he placed the young Emperor with a strong guard of
Italians and Greeks, and then ran along the wall with a body of soldiers,
shouting aloud: “long live the Emperor John Palaiologos!” When dawn
broke and the populace realised that their young sovereign was within
the walls, their demonstrations convinced Cantacuzene that resistance
would be sanguinary, even if successful. He therefore relinquished the
diadem which he could not retain, and retired into a monastery, while
John V, accompanied by Francesco and the rest of the Italians, marched
in triumph into the palace. The restored Emperor was as good as his
word; he bestowed the hand of his sister upon his benefactor, and gave
to Francesco as her dowry the island of Lesbos. On July 17, 1355,
Francesco I began his reign<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.</p>

<p>Connected by marriage with the Greek Imperial house, the Genoese
lord of Lesbos seems to have met with no resistance from his Greek
subjects, who would naturally regard him not so much in the light of
an alien conqueror as in that of a lawful ruler by the grace of the
Emperor. He soon learnt to speak their language<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>, and continued to
assist his Greek brother-in-law with advice and personal service. At
the moment of his accession, the Greek Empire was menaced by the
Turks, who had lately crossed over into Europe, and occupied Gallipoli,
and by Matthew Cantacuzene, the eldest son of the deposed Emperor.
In the very next year the capture of the Sultan Orkhan’s son, Halil,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
by Greek pirates from Foglia Vecchia, at that time a Byzantine fief,
enabled John V to divide these two enemies by promising to obtain
the release of the Sultan’s son. The promise proved, indeed, to be
hard of fulfilment, for John Kalothetos, the Greek governor of Foglia
Vecchia, resisted the joint attacks of the Emperor and a Turkish chief,
whom John V had summoned to aid him, until he received a large
ransom and a high-sounding title. It was during these operations, in
the spring of 1357, that the Emperor, on the advice of Francesco
Gattilusio, treacherously invited his Turkish ally to visit him on an islet
off Foglia and then arrested him<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>. Such reliance, indeed, did John place
in his brother-in-law, whose interests coincided with his own, that,
when Matthew Cantacuzene was captured by the Serbs and handed over
to the Emperor, the latter sent the children of his rival to Lesbos, and
even meditated sending thither Matthew himself, because he knew that
they would be in safe keeping<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>. In 1366, when the Bulgarian Tsar,
John Shishman, had treacherously arrested John V, and the Greeks of
Byzantium, hard pressed by the Turks, sought the help of the chivalrous
<i>Conte verde</i>, Amedeo VI of Savoy, Francesco Gattilusio was present
with one of his nephews at the siege and capture of Gallipoli from the
Ottomans and assisted at the taking of Mesembria from the Bulgarians<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>.
But fear of Murad I made him refuse to see or speak to his wife’s nephew,
Manuel, when the latter, after plotting against the Sultan, sought refuge
in Lesbos<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as a Genoese, he naturally had difficulties with the
Venetians. Thus, we find him capturing<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> in the Ægean a Venetian
colonist from Negroponte, and quite early in his reign he imitated the
bad example of his predecessor, Domenico Cattaneo, and coined gold
pieces in exact counterfeit of the Venetian ducat, although of different
weight. This was so serious an offence, that the Venetian Government
made a formal complaint at Genoa, and in 1357 the Doge of his native
city wrote to Francesco<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> bidding him discontinue this dishonest practice,
which augured badly for the future of his administration, and would
entail severe penalties upon him, if he insisted in its continuance.
Francesco felt himself strong enough to go on his way, heedless of the
ducal thunders alike of Genoa and of Venice, and coins of himself and
of at least four out of his five successors have been preserved. The great
war, which broke out between the two Republics in 1377 on account of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
the cession of Tenedos by the usurper Andronikos to Genoa and its
seizure by Venice, must have placed Francesco in a difficult position.
He was, it is true, a Genoese but he was also brother-in-law of John V,
whom Andronikos had deposed and who had promised the disputed
island, which he and Francesco knew so well, to Venice. Accordingly,
when the treaty of Turin imposed upon Venice the surrender of Tenedos
to Amedeo VI of Savoy, who was to raze the castle to the ground at the
cost of Genoa, yet the islanders none the less swore that they would
retain their independence. Muazzo, the Venetian governor, excused his
action in refusing to give up the island by pleading Francesco’s intrigues.
An agent of the Lesbian lord, he wrote, one Raffaele of Quarto, had
stirred up the inhabitants, some 4000 in number, to resist the cession,
by spreading a rumour that, if Tenedos fell into Genoese hands, the
Venetian colonists would all be forced to turn Jews or emigrate<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>. When,
however, Venice found herself reluctantly compelled to force her
recalcitrant officer to carry out the provisions of the treaty, Francesco
helped to victual the Venetian fleet, and Tenedos was reduced to be the
desert that it long remained.</p>

<p>While such were his relations with the Byzantine Empire and the
rival Republics of the West, the Papacy regarded Francesco as one of
the factors in the Union of the Churches and thereby as a champion of
Christendom against the Turks. When Innocent VI in 1356, despatched
St Peter Thomas and another bishop to compass the Union of the Old
and the New Rome, he recommended his two envoys to the lord of
Lesbos. Thirteen years later, Francesco accompanied his brother-in-law,
the Emperor John V, to Rome, and signed as one of the witnesses
of that formal confession of the Catholic faith, which the sorely-pressed
sovereign made on October 18, 1369, in the palace of the Holy Ghost
before Urban V<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>. He was one of the potentates summoned by Gregory
XI in 1372 to attend the Congress<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> of Thebes on October 1, 1373, to
consider the Turkish peril—a peril which at that time specially menaced
his island—and in the following year the Pope recommended Smyrna
to his care, and sent two theologians to convince him, a strenuous fighter
against the Turks, and defender of Christendom beyond the seas, that
the Union of the Churches would be a better defence against them than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
armed force<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>. The Popes might well have thought that no one could be
a better instrument of their favourite plan than this Catholic brother-in-law
of the Greek Emperor. But the astute Genoese was too wise to
compel his Greek subjects to accept his creed. Throughout his reign,
besides a Roman Catholic Archbishop, there was a Greek Metropolitan
of Mytilene, and under his successor the Metropolitan throne of Methymna
was also occupied<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>. The Armenian colony, settled in Lesbos, preferred,
however, to seek shelter in Kos under the Knights of St John rather than
remain as his subjects, without proper protection from a hostile raid<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>.</p>

<p>The success of their kinsman encouraged other members of the
Gattilusio clan to seek a comfortable <i>seigneurie</i> in the Levant. The
barony of Ænos, at the mouth of the Maritza, had been assigned in the
partition of the Byzantine Empire to the Crusaders, and, although reconquered
by the Greeks, the exiled Latin Emperor Baldwin II had
been pleased to consider it as still his to bestow, together with the titular
kingdom of Salonika, upon Hugues, Duke of Burgundy, in 1266.
Besieged by Bulgarians and Tartars in 1265, and invaded by the
Catalans in 1308, it had been governed in the middle of the fourteenth
century by Nikephoros II Angelos, the dethroned Despot of Epeiros,
the son-in-law and nominee of John Cantacuzene. When, however,
Cantacuzene fell, the Despot thought it more prudent to surrender the
city to John V, who thus, in 1356, became its master. We do not know
the precise time or manner of its transference to the Gattilusio family.
A later Byzantine historian<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>, however, states that the inhabitants,
dissatisfied with the Imperial governor, called in a member of the
reigning family of Lesbos, who was able to maintain his position owing
to the domestic quarrels in the Imperial family, and by payment of an
annual tribute to the Sultan, when the Turks became masters of Thrace
and Macedonia. Whether the ancient barony became a Genoese possession
by the will of the natives or by grant of the Emperor, one fact is
certain, that in June, 1384, it was in the possession of Francesco’s
brother, Nicolò<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>. Some six weeks later, a great upheaval of nature,
prophesied, it was afterwards said, by a Lesbian monk, made the new
lord of Ænos regent of his brother’s island also.</p>

<p>The violent end of the first Gattilusio who reigned in Lesbos was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
long remembered in the island. On August 6, 1384, a terrible earthquake
buried him beneath the ruins of the castle which he had built, as an
inscription proudly informs us<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>, some eleven years before. After a long
and painful search, his mutilated body was found and laid to rest in a
coffin, which he had already prepared, in the church of St John Baptist,
which he had founded. By his side were laid the mangled bodies of two
of his sons, Andronico and Domenico, who, with his wife, had also
perished in the disaster. A third son, named Jacopo, escaped, however,
by a miracle. At the time of the shock, he was sleeping by the side of
his brothers in a tower of the castle; next day, however, he was discovered
by a good woman in a vineyard near the Windmills at the foot
of the fortress. The woman hastened to tell the good news to the chief
men of the town, who came and fetched the young survivor. The boy
took the oath on the Gospels as lord of Lesbos before the people and
the nobles, and, as he was still a minor, his uncle, Nicolò Gattilusio, lord
of Ænos, who hastened over to Lesbos on the news of the catastrophe,
shared authority with him. In order to perpetuate the name of the
popular founder of the dynasty, Jacopo on his accession took the name
of Francesco II<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>.</p>

<p>The joint government of uncle and nephew lasted for three years,
when a dispute arose between them, and Nicolò returned to the direction
of his Thracian barony. In November, 1388, Francesco II joined the
league of the Knights of Rhodes, Jacques I of Cyprus, the Genoese
Chartered Company of Chios, and the Commune of Pera against the
designs of the Sultan Murad I. His popularity with his Perote compatriots
was such, that, on the occasion of a visit to Constantinople
in 1392, they gave him a banquet; but four years later they complained
that he had not performed his treaty obligations, made in 1388, against
the Turks. In the summer of 1396, Pera was besieged by the forces
of Bayezid I, and although Francesco was actually in the port of Constantinople
at the time, and his galley was stationed in the Golden Horn
near “the Huntsman’s Gate” in the modern district of Aivan Serai the
Commune thought it necessary to draw up a formal protest against his
inaction and execute it on the stem of his ship. He replied by offering
to aid his fellow-Genoese, if they would make a sortie, and his galley
subsequently assisted the Venetians in relieving the capital<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
the disastrous defeat of the Christians at the battle of Nikopolis later
in the same year, both he and Nicolò of Ænos rendered signal services
to the Sultan’s noble French prisoners, and Lesbos emerged into
prominence throughout the French-speaking world. Thither came the
Duke of Burgundy’s chamberlain, Guillaume de l’Aigle, on his preliminary
mission to mollify the heart of Bayezid, with whom Francesco
had such influence that he was able to obtain leave for his sick cousin,
Enguerrand VII de Coucy, to remain behind at Brusa, when the rest
of the captives were dragged farther up country by the Sultan<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>. The
humane feelings of the lord of Lesbos were doubtless further moved
by the fact that de Coucy was, through his mother, an Austrian princess,
connected with the reigning family of Constantinople, from which he
was himself descended, and by the recent establishment of a French
protectorate over Genoa.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he offered bail for his suffering relative, and when
Marshal Boucicault, another of the prisoners, was set free to raise the
amount necessary for their ransom, Francesco and other rich merchants
of Lesbos advanced him the preliminary sum of 30,000 francs. Nicolò
of Ænos willingly lent 2000 ducats more, and sent the prisoners a
present of fish, bread and sugar, while his wife added a goodly supply
of linen, for which they expressed their deep gratitude<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>. Of the total
ransom, fixed at 200,000 ducats, Francesco and Nicolò, anxious to
please the King of France and the Duke of Burgundy, respectively
made themselves liable for 110,000 and 40,000, which the prisoners
promised to repay as soon as possible. Half of these two sums was
actually paid, and the lord of Ænos further furnished on account of
the Comte de Nevers 10,000 ducats to a son of Bayezid and another
Turk, who had guarded that nobleman on the day of his capture. Some
years later the two Gattilusj of Lesbos and Ænos sent in a claim for
what they had advanced and for sundry expenses amounting in all to
108,500 ducats. Another member of the family lent 5075 ducats, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
during his stay in Lesbos the Comte de Nevers negotiated another loan
from his host for 2500 more<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>. These sums show the wealth and credit
of these merchant princes.</p>

<p>When the ransom had been settled, the three French and Burgundian
envoys who had been treating with Bayezid, embarked for
Lesbos, escorted by Francesco and Nicolò and accompanied by one of
the ransomed prisoners, who took with him to Burgundy a natural son
of Francesco, destined to become the grandfather of Giuliano Gattilusio,
the terrible corsair of the next century<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>. The rest of the prisoners
followed early in July, and remained for six weeks the guests of
Francesco and his lady, a noble dame of gentle breeding and
European accomplishments, acquired at the court of Marie de Bourbon,
titular Empress of Constantinople and Princess of Achaia, in whose
society she had been educated. Feeling herself highly honoured at
the presence of the Comte de Nevers and his companions in the
castle of Lesbos, she clothed them with fine linen and cloth of
Damascus, according to the fashion of the Levant, not forgetting to
replenish the wardrobe of their retainers, while her husband and his
uncle rendered them every honour and assisted them in their necessity.
The visit terminated in the middle of August, when two galleys,
equipped by the Knights of Rhodes, transported them to that island,
their next stage on the homeward voyage. Their generous host
stood on the shore till the Rhodian galleys had sunk beneath the
horizon<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>. A few hours earlier he had obtained the signature of a
treaty which might confer a solid advantage upon his own family and
give an illusory hope of future glory to his departing guests. His
daughter Eugenia had just married John Palaiologos, Despot of
Selymbria, the Emperor Manuel II’s nephew and rival. Through the
agency of Francesco this potentate ceded his claims to the Empire to
King Charles VI of France in return for a French castle and a perpetual
annuity of 25,000 gold ducats<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>. Thus in Lesbos, on the morrow
of Nikopolis, the French could dream of re-establishing the long extinct
Latin Empire of Romania!</p>

<p>Francesco had not seen the last of the French prisoners. In the
summer of 1399, Boucicault, sent by Charles VI to assist Manuel II in
defending Constantinople from the Turks, arrived at Lesbos, which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
had last visited two years before. Francesco received him with outward
signs of joy, but told him that he had already informed the Turks of
this new expedition, as he was bound to do by the treaties which he
had with them. The position of the Lesbian lord was, indeed, of no small
difficulty. It was his interest to stand well with Bayezid, while his
son-in-law, John Palaiologos, who spent much of his time in the island,
had received, as the son of Manuel’s elder brother, Turkish assistance in
his blockade of the Imperial city. The diplomatic Levantine did not,
however, wish to offend his powerful guest; he therefore offered to
accompany him, and ordered a galley to be made ready to join the
expedition. But the information which he had supplied to Bayezid had
put the Turks upon their guard. A raid in Asia Minor was Boucicault’s
sole military success; but he achieved, probably thanks to the influence
of Francesco, the reconciliation of Manuel with his nephew, whom the
French Marshal fetched from Selymbria to Constantinople. Manuel then
departed with Boucicault to seek aid at the courts of Europe, while John
acted as his viceroy on the Bosporos and received, in the presence of the
Marshal, the promise of Salonika as his future residence<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>. Thus, during
the absence of Manuel, Francesco’s daughter Eugenia sat upon the
Byzantine throne as the consort of the Emperor’s representative, while
her sister Helene married Stephen Lazarevich, Despot of Serbia, who had
made her acquaintance during a visit to Lesbos on his return from the
stricken field of Angora<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. Francesco was at that time holding Foglia
Vecchia on a lease from the <i>maona</i> of Chios, and his tact and presents
saved the place in that crisis from the covetous hands of the victorious
Timour and his grandson<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>.</p>

<p>When Manuel returned to Constantinople in 1403, he refused to
carry out his promised gift of Salonika. Before the battle of Angora
had decided the fate of Bayezid, and the issue between the Turks and
the Mongols was still uncertain, John Palaiologos had agreed—it was
said—to surrender Constantinople and become a tributary of the Sultan,
in the event of a Turkish victory. This was Manuel’s, excuse for refusing
to allow his nephew to reside at Salonika and for banishing him to
Lemnos. John thereupon appealed to his father-in-law for assistance,
and Francesco, early in 1403, sailed with five vessels to attack Salonika.
Hearing that Boucicault, then French governor of Genoa, whose interest
in Lesbos had just been evinced by the despatch of an embassy thither,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
was once more in the Levant on a punitive expedition against King
Janus of Cyprus, who had besieged the Genoese colony of Famagosta,
Francesco despatched a vessel to meet the Marshal, reminding him that
he had been a witness of the Emperor’s promise and begging him to aid
in taking Salonika<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>. Boucicault did not accede to this request; on the
contrary, two vessels from Lesbos and two from Ænos went to assist
him in his operations against the King of Cyprus, and remained with
him till shortly before he reached the Venetian colony of Modon on his
homeward voyage. Manuel ended by bestowing Salonika upon John
Palaiologos, but the attacks made by Boucicault upon Venetian trade
in the Levant and the consequent hostilities cost Nicolò Gattilusio,
owing to his Genoese origin, the loss of 3000 ducats in gold, seized by the
Venetians at Modon<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>.</p>

<p>In October of this eventful year of Boucicault’s cruise, there arrived
at Lesbos a mission, sent by Enrique III of Castile to Timour, the victor
of Angora, whose court was then at Samarkand. The narrative of the
Castilian ambassador, Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, gives us an interesting
account of the island under the second Gattilusio. He found the town
“built on a high hill near the sea,” and “surrounded by a wall with many
towers,” outside of which was “a large suburb.” Besides the capital,
Lesbos contained “several villages and castles,” while the neighbourhood
of the city was well-cultivated and abounded in gardens and vineyards.
At one time—probably before the earthquake—“very large houses and
churches” had stood near the town, and at one end of the city were
“the ruins of great palaces, and in the middle of the ruins about 40
blocks of white marble.” The local tradition was, that “on the top of
these blocks there was once a platform, where those of the city met in
council.” During the five days of their stay the envoys made the
acquaintance of John Palaiologos, who was then residing in his wife’s
old home, and heard the tragic story of the late lord’s death, of his
successor’s marvellous preservation and of the recent expedition against
Salonika<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>. Thus, in the reign of Francesco II, Lesbos was frequently
visited by important personages from the West, and was their last
stopping-place in Latin lands on their way to Constantinople or to
Asia. Descended from the famous houses of Byzantium and Savoy, and
connected with that of Austria, the lord of Mytilene and lessee of Foglia
Vecchia was regarded by Western visitors as “a great baron”; Eastern
potentates sought the hands of his daughters in marriage, and when one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
of them married the heir of the powerful Giovanni de’ Grimaldi<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>,
governor of Nice and usurper of Monaco, the dowry of 5000 gold ducats
which she brought from Lesbos was considered a large sum on the
Riviera. Although born in the Levant, he still kept up the family
connexion with his paternal city. Both he and his uncle had financial
transactions with Genoa<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>, and Francesco was patron of the family
church of San Giacomo at Sestri Ponente<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>. At the same time, while
Latin archbishops held the see of Mytilene, his relations with the
dignitaries of the Orthodox church were excellent. The Œcumenical
Patriarch addressed him as “well-beloved nephew of the Emperor,”
and his uncle Nicolò as the “Emperor’s kinsman by marriage<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>, the most
noble, glorious, and prudent <i>archon</i> of Ænos,” whose consent was sought
for the appointment of a Metropolitan to that long vacant see<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>. With
Venice the Gattilusj, as befitted Genoese, at times had difficulties. In
1398 corsairs, sallying forth from their dominions, did much damage to
the Cretans who sailed under the Venetian flag; but the Republic none
the less allowed the wax of Lesbos to be exported at certain seasons for
sale in her dominions<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>.</p>

<p>After an eventful reign of 20 years, Francesco II died, if we may
believe an anonymous Greek chronologist<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>, on October 26, 1404. His
end was strangely similar to that of his father. On a journey through
the island, while passing the night in one of the lofty towers then
common in the Archipelago, he was stung by a scorpion. Alarmed at
his cries, his attendants and nobles climbed up into his room in such
numbers that the floor collapsed and he was killed on the spot leaving
three sons, Jacopo, Palamede and Dorino, of whom the eldest Jacopo
became his successor<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>. The heir was, however, still a minor, and
accordingly once again Nicolò came and acted as regent. His friendly
policy as regent and his support of her subjects in the Levant on more
than one occasion called forth the warm praise of Venice; but his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
fortification of Tenedos provoked an indignant protest<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>. Moreover the
Greeks of Lesbos can scarcely have been edified by the appointment of
rival Latin bishops—the result of the schism in the Western Church—which
occurred during his regency<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>. In the spring of 1409 he died<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>, and
Jacopo, then of age, assumed the government of Lesbos, while Francesco’s
younger son, Palamede<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>, succeeded his uncle and guardian at
Ænos. Nicolò’s fame long lingered in the Levant. Kritoboulos<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> half a
century later ascribed to him the achievements of Francesco I, the
founder of the dynasty, whose wisdom, and education, whose courage
and physical gifts he extols, whom all Syria and Egypt feared and
propitiated with annual blackmail, for his numerous navy ravaged their
coasts and even the Libyan littoral.</p>

<p>Jacopo’s policy was to favour Genoese interests where they conflicted
with Venetian, but to co-operate with the two rival Republics when they
showed signs of uniting against his dreaded neighbours, the Turks.
Thus, he aided Centurione Zaccaria, the Genoese Prince of Achaia, in
his campaign against the Tocchi of Cephalonia and Zante, who were
thereby compelled to invoke the protection of Venice; while the
Venetians threatened to sequestrate all Lesbian merchandise in Crete,
unless he gave satisfaction for the seizure of a Cretan merchantman<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>.
Venetian and Genoese subjects, however, suffered alike from the
reprisals provoked by the attack of two Lesbian galleys upon the
Saracens of Damietta; and Jacopo had a counter grievance in the illegal
levy of toll upon his people by the Genoese of Chios<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>. Towards the Turks
he was, from his position, obliged to be deferential, except when he saw
prospect of common action against them. If the Knights of Rhodes
complained that he had sheltered the Turks, and so saved them from
destruction at the hands of those zealous champions of Christendom<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>,
he was ready, in 1415, to join the latter, the Genoese of Chios, and the
Venetian Republic in an anti-Turkish league; while he did homage to
Mohammed I and aided first that Sultan and then Murad II in the
suppression of Djouneïd of Aïdin, when fortune smiled upon them<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
1426, the threatened declaration of war by Venice upon Genoa, then
under Milanese domination, caused him some embarrassment; but the
Genoese Government bade him<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> not to be afraid of Venetian threats.
Not long after this, probably in 1428, Jacopo died<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>. An anonymous
Greek informs us that he had married Bonne, “the fair daughter of the
lord of Nice near Marseilles” but this statement would appear to be due
to a confusion with the marriage of his sister with Pietro de’ Grimaldi,
for Bonne, the offspring of that union espoused Louis Cossa, lord of
Berre, unless the Bonne mentioned was the daughter of Amedeo VIII
of Savoy, in whose dominions Nice was then included<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>. In 1421,
however, Valentina D’Oria is described as “lady of Mytilene<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>.” At any
rate, it seems probable that he left no issue, for his successor, Dorino I,
is described in a Genoese document and by a traveller of this period as
“brother” of Palamede, lord of Ænos<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>, and therefore of Jacopo.
Dorino, whose name was derived from the famous Genoese house of
D’Oria, allied by marriage with many Gattilusj, had already had
experience of ruling for several years over Foglia Vecchia as his
appanage—a fact still commemorated by his coins and an inscription
there<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>, which describes him as its “lord” in 1423-4. This former possession
of the Zaccaria is first mentioned as administered by the
Gattilusj in 1402, and remained united with the Lesbian branch of the
family till 1455.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ænos had prospered under the rule of Palamede. Six
inscriptions, still extant there, proclaim the activity of the masons
during the early years of his long reign—the erection of the churches
of the Chrysopege and of St Nicholas by two private citizens and the
completion of three other public works<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. But Palamede not only
embellished his domain; he also extended it. The neighbouring island
of Samothrace, a Greek possession since the reconquest of Constantinople
from the Latins, now owned his sway—for in 1433, when Bertrandon de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
la Brocquière<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> visited Ænos, he wrote that Samothrace also belonged
to its lord. In that island, then known as Mandrachi and celebrated for
its honey and its goats, Palamede erected on March 26, 1431, and
extended in 1433, a new fortress for the protection of its numerous
population, as two inscriptions in its walls, one in Greek, one in Latin<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
still remind us. The Genoese lord, we are told, was interested in the past
history of his dominions; he “loved greatly to hear learned discussions,”
and to him a contemporary scholar, John Kanaboutzes, applied the
saying of Plato about philosophers and kings. To his desire to know what
Dionysios of Halikarnassos had written about Samothrace we owe the
brief commentary on that author, compiled at his command by that
writer, a native of Foglia<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>, whose family was connected with Ænos<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>—one
of several instances, where Italian rulers of Greece showed a consciousness
of that country’s great past. Like his brother Jacopo,
Palamede was inclined to support the Genoese Prince of Achaia, and
the Venetian admiral was ordered to remonstrate with him, should
occasion require<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>.</p>

<p>Although more than seventy years had by this time elapsed since
Francesco I had left Genoa for the Levant, the connexion between the
distant Republic and his descendants in the East was never closer than
now. In 1428, and again in 1444, the Genoese Government, although it
forbade the circulation of Lesbian ducats in Genoa and district, and
repudiated responsibility for the harm done by the Gattilusj to the
subjects of the Sultan of Egypt, specially consulted “the lords of
Mytilene, Ænos and Foglia Vecchia” whether they desired to be included
or no in the treaties of peace, which it had just concluded with
King Alfonso V of Aragon. “The many services rendered to us and to
the community of Genoa by you and your ancestors”—so runs one of
these interesting despatches—“make us realise that in all treaties
involving peace or war we ought to consider your honour and advancement.
For your welfare, your misfortunes, are equally ours.” Dorino I
replied that he wished to be so included, and his agents accordingly
ratified the peace at Genoa on his behalf in 1429. When, two years later,
Genoa was drawn into the war between her Milanese masters and Venice,
the Archbishop of Milan, who was at that time the governor of Genoa,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
notified Dorino of the outbreak of hostilities, following the precedent
set in the case of his father and grandfather, warned that “most
distinguished of our citizens” to put his island in a state of defence and
begged him to aid any Genoese colony that might require assistance<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>.
So much importance was attached at Milan to his support, that
Francesco Sforza, the Duke, accredited Benedetto Folco of Forlì to the
Lesbian court, in order to urge Dorino against Venice<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>. At the same
time, the Genoese Government, “remembering that in all its past
victories the galleys of the Gattilusj had borne their part,” invited the
lord of Lesbos to co-operate with Ceba, the Genoese commander who
was to be despatched for the relief of Chios from the Venetians, and
requested him to send a galley to that island. Dorino replied in a loyal
strain, whereupon the Genoese Government thanked him for this
display of fidelity, traditional in his family, and again urged him to
equip his galley for the defence of Chios. Two other despatches,
following in rapid succession, begged him to inform the Chians of the
speedy arrival of the Genoese fleet and to see that his own galley was in
Chian waters by the middle of May. Dorino was as good as his word,
and gave orders that a Lesbian galley should join the expedition; but
before the latter arrived, the Venetians had raised the siege. As a
reward for his services, the commander of the Genoese fleet and the
governors of Pera and Chios were instructed to provide for the safety
of his little state, and the home government invited him to rely upon
its unshakable affection in time of need. Influential Genoese marriages
stimulated this feeling. Dorino had married a D’Oria; Palamede’s
daughter Caterina now married another; while her sisters, Ginevra and
Costanza, respectively espoused Ludovico and Gian Galeazzo de Campo-fregoso,
relatives of the then reigning Doge, and the former soon to
be Doge himself. Thus Lesbian interests were well represented at Genoa.
In return, Genoa frequently requested Dorino to see that justice was
done to her subjects in his dominions, even to the detriment of his own
family<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.</p>

<p>Genoa found Dorino no less useful as a diplomatist than as an ally,
for the lord of Lesbos and Foglia Vecchia had married his daughter
Maria to Alexander, second son of Alexios IV, Emperor of Trebizond,
in whose dominions the Genoese, owing to their Black Sea colonies,
had important commercial interests, latterly greatly injured by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
pro-Venetian policy of that sovereign. According to the Trapezuntine
practice, Alexios had raised his eldest son John IV to the Imperial
dignity in his own lifetime; but his unfilial heir conspired against him,
was driven into exile, and replaced by his next brother Alexander.
John IV was, however, as favourable to the Genoese as his father to the
Venetians, and was restored with the assistance of a Genoese of Caffa.
Alexios IV was murdered in 1429; but John IV was not allowed to reign
undisturbed. His brother Alexander fled to Constantinople, where his
sister was wife of the Emperor John VI, and contracted a marriage with
Dorino’s daughter, in order that he might secure his support, and
through him, that of Genoa, against the Emperor of Trebizond. When
the Spanish traveller, Pero Tafur, visited Lesbos at this time he found
Alexander there engaged in levying a fleet for his restoration. This did
not, however, suit Genoese policy, and accordingly the Doge of Genoa
requested Dorino in 1438 to act as peacemaker between the two brothers
and to invite his son-in-law to reside at Constantinople or in Lesbos
on an annuity chargeable on the revenues of Trebizond<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>. Another
matrimonial alliance brought Dorino’s family into renewed relations
with the Palaiologoi. In 1440, an old link between the two families had
been snapped by the death of Eugenia Gattilusio, widow of the Emperor
John VI’s cousin and namesake<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>—an event which was doubtless the
occasion when the castle of Kokkinos on the coast of Lemnos, which
had been her widow’s portion, passed into the hands of Dorino<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>. On
July 27 of the following year, however, the Emperor’s brother, the
Despot Constantine, afterwards the last Christian ruler of Byzantium,
married Dorino’s daughter Caterina, a marriage arranged by the
historian Phrantzes. This union did not last long; after a brief honeymoon
in Lesbos, Constantine left his bride in her father’s care, and set
out, accompanied by a Lesbian galley, for the Morea, nor did he see her
again till his return in the following July. At Lesbos he took her on
board his ship; but, when he reached Lemnos on his way to Constantinople,
he had to take refuge behind the walls of Kokkinos from
the attacks of a Turkish fleet. The Turks in vain besieged the castle of
the Gattilusj for 27 days, and the strain and anxiety of the siege caused
the death of his wife, which occurred at Palaiokastro in August. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
the ill-fated second consort of the last hero of the Byzantine Empire
was laid to rest<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, besides the acquisition of Kokkinos, thus courageously
saved by his heroic son-in-law, Dorino had received from the Greek
Empire the island of Thasos, which more than a century before had
belonged to the Genoese family of Zaccaria. Indeed, if we may accept
the two allusions to the Gattilusj in the Greek version of Bondelmonti<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
as the work of that traveller, Thasos, which was Byzantine in September,
1414, had been given to Jacopo as a fief before 1420. At any rate, a
Thasian inscription of April 1, 1434, now preserved in the wall of the
church of St Athanasios at Kastro, informs us that a tower was built
there by Oberto de’ Grimaldi<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> a member of the well-known Ligurian
family who is mentioned elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> as a captain in the service of Dorino.
Ten years later, the archæologist, Cyriacus of Ancona, upon visiting
Thasos, found that Dorino had recently bestowed the island upon his
son, Francesco III, who was still under the control of a preceptor,
Francesco Pedemontano.</p>

<p>The indefatigable antiquary may have paid an earlier visit to
Lesbos in 1431, but the accounts which he has left of the Gattilusj, their
dominions, and the neighbouring islands of the Thracian Sea range
from 1444 to 1447. In Lesbos he was well received by Dorino, who
promised to aid him in exploring the whole island. He had, indeed,
arrived at a fortunate moment, for the rumour of a threatened Turkish
invasion had ceased, so that the lord of Lesbos had leisure for archæology,
and his visitor could examine “the remains of the temple of
Diana,” and “the baths of Jove,” whose name was carved in the midst
of them<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>. With Dorino’s captain, Oberto de’ Grimaldi, he sailed to
Foglia Vecchia, where the Gattilusj had a factory, as at Lesbos, for the
production of alum, and made the acquaintance of “the Master
Kanaboutzes,” probably the author of the commentary on Dionysios,
who could tell him all about the Foglie, of which he was a native<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>. In
Thasos, the third domain of the elder branch of the Gattilusj, he spent
Christmas day, and composed a long Latin inscription as well as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
Italian poem in honour of young Francesco. The enthusiastic guest
prayed that the beginning of his host’s rule over Thasos might be of
as good omen as “the yule log thrown on the fire in the turreted castle”;
that the yoke of the barbarian Turks might be removed from Thrace,
that the former dependencies of the island there might return to his
sway, and that Francesco’s patron saint, St John the Evangelist, might
protect this “native offspring of the Palaiologoi, this pride of the most
noble Gatalusian race.” “What Thasian nymph,” he asks, “could have
deprived Lesbos of her Francesco?” The attraction was the lordship
of an island, which had been described by Bondelmonti as well-peopled,
very fertile and containing three fair towns. Francesco had, indeed,
begun well by restoring the principal city, thus earning a dedicatory
inscription by the Thasian citizens and colonists, and by erecting at
the entrance of the harbour some fine marble statues, which an ancient
inscription showed to have represented the members of the Thasian
council. At this time the island could boast of six other towns beside
its “marble city,” whose walls attracted the admiration of the traveller.
Under the guidance of Carlo de’ Grimaldi and “the learned Giovanni of
Novara,” he inspected the numerous ancient tombs outside, the large
amphitheatre with no less than 20 rows then standing intact, and the
akropolis of the city<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>.</p>

<p>The worthy Cyriacus was no less hospitably received by the junior
branch of the Gattilusj. At Ænos he met Palamede with his two sons
Giorgio and Dorino II, and was delighted to find there an old friend in
the person of Cristoforo Dentuto, envoy extraordinary of Genoa in
the Levant. Accompanied by “the prince of Ænos and Samothrace”
as he calls Palamede, and by Francesco Calvi, the latter’s secretary, he
was taken to see “the great tomb of Polydoros, son of Priam,” some five
stadia beyond the walls, admired the sculptured figures of fauns and
animals there, and copied an ancient Greek inscription from the marble
base of a statue that stood before “the prince’s court.” Letters of
introduction from Palamede and Francesco of Thasos secured for him
a warm reception at the monastery of Hagia Laura on Mount Athos<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>.
At Samothrace, Joannes Laskaris Rhyndakenos, Palamede’s prefect of
the island, personally conducted the antiquary to the old city, where
he saw “ancient walls and the remains of a marble temple of Neptune”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
(known to modern archæologists as “the Dorian marble temple”),
“fragments of huge columns, epistylia and bases, and doorposts,
adorned with the crowned heads of bulls and other figures”—now
identified with the remains of a round building built by Arsinöe,
daughter of Ptolemy Soter. Thence he went to “the new castle, founded
by Palamede” some thirteen years before, and built to protect his new
town of “Capsulum.” Close to the tower he saw to his delight “several
ancient marbles, with dances of Nymphs sculptured and inscriptions in
Latin and Greek”—the two reliefs of dancing Nymphs now in the
Louvre<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. From his accounts of the neighbouring islands, we learn that
Imbros, where his guide was a noble and learned Imbriote, Hermodoros
Michael Kritoboulos, the historian, in 1444 was still Byzantine, and
“governed for the Emperor John Palaiologos” by that same noble,
Manuel Asan, of whom inscriptions have been found there, and who had
lately restored two-thirds of the akropolis<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>. We find, too, that in 1447
Theodore Branas was Byzantine governor of Lemnos, where the
Gattilusj as yet held only the castle of Kokkinos<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>.</p>

<p>The visit of the antiquary of Ancona to the Gattilusj was the calm
before the storm, which was so soon to burst upon them. Even while
Cyriacus was their guest, the fatal battle of Varna made Murad II
master of the Near East. For a few years, indeed, the Gattilusj went
on marrying and giving in marriage, as if the end of their rule were
not at hand. In 1444, Dorino’s daughter Ginevra married Giacomo II
Crispo, Duke of the Archipelago<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>; five years later the lord of Lesbos
sent the Archbishop of Mytilene, at that time the celebrated Leonardo
of Chios, to Rome to obtain from the Pope a dispensation for the
marriage of his eldest surviving son, Domenico, and a daughter of
Palamede. As the two young people were first-cousins, Ludovico de
Campo-fregoso, Palamede’s son-in-law and at that time Doge of Genoa,
begged the Pope not to grant the dispensation, and as an example of
the iniquity of such an alliance he instanced the case of Dorino’s
firstborn (presumably Francesco III of Thasos), who had married
another daughter of Palamede and had died less than six months<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
afterwards. The Pope refused his consent, and the marriage did not
take place<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Gattilusj, partly by tribute paid ever since the reign of
Murad I<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>, partly by tact, had managed to keep the Turks at a distance.
On one occasion, when Constantinople had been threatened, the Pope
had offered to pay the expenses of the Lesbian galley, if Dorino would
agree to sent it thither; but the Genoese Government, while transmitting
his Holiness’ offer and praising the services of the Gattilusj to Christendom,
recognised their natural unwillingness to offend the Sultan and
advised Dorino, if he did send aid, to pretend that he was merely
protecting Genoese interests at Pera. The Greek Emperor was able to
raise a loan, if he received no actual assistance, at Ænos<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>; but in 1450,
at last, Lesbos was attacked. Murad despatched a large fleet under
Baltaoghli, the first in the list of Turkish admirals, against the island,
and his men carried off more than 3000 souls, slaughtered many cattle,
destroyed the flourishing city of Kallone, and inflicted damage to the
amount of more than 150,000 ducats. It was probably on this occasion
that the lady of Lesbos, Orietta d’Oria, performed the prodigy of valour
that won her a niche in the literary Pantheon of her native city besides
the men of her father’s house. At the time of the invasion, she seems
to have been in the town of Molivos, the ancient Methymna, whose
inhabitants, exhausted from lack of food, were on the point of surrendering,
when she appeared among them in full armour, and led them
to victory against the astonished Turks. Thereupon Dorino was able to
secure by a timely present and the increase of his tribute to 2000 gold
pieces a renewal of the peace which he protested that he had never
broken. He was, however, under no illusions as to the durability of this
truce. He wrote to Genoa, asking for assistance, reminding the Republic
that he was of Genoese origin and that he had often aided her to the
best of his power with men, ships, and money. Unless, therefore, she
could protect him, he would be reluctantly compelled to look elsewhere
for help. At the same time, after the fashion of the Christian princes
of the Levant on the eve of the Turkish conquest, he announced his
intention of sending an expedition to obtain his rights from the Emperor
John IV of Trebizond, who had also maltreated the Genoese of Caffa,
and begged the Republic to receive and revictual his galleys in her Black
Sea ports. This last request was granted<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>The Turkish conquest of Constantinople, although it sounded the
death-knell of the Latin states in the Levant, was of momentary benefit
to the Gattilusj. They had been close relatives and good friends of the
Greek Imperial family, and one of them, a certain Laudisio, had distinguished
himself in the defence of the city<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>; but, when all was over,
they hastened to profit by its fall. The two islands of Lemnos and
Imbros, from their position near the mouth of the Dardanelles, have
always possessed great strategic importance. Under the Latin Empire,
Lemnos had been the fief of the Lord High Admiral, who bore the title
of Grand-duke; under the Palaiologoi it had been either the appanage
of an Imperial prince, or had been entrusted to the government of some
great noble. So greatly was it coveted, that Alfonso V of Aragon had
made it the price of his aid for the relief of Constantinople<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>, while during
the siege Constantine had promised it to Giustiniani, if the Turks were
repulsed<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>. When the news of the disaster reached these islands, the
Byzantine authorities fled on board Italian ships, while many of the
inhabitants sought refuge in Chios or in the Venetian colonies. There
was, however, one leading personage in Imbros, who was resolved to
remain and make terms with the victors. This was Kritoboulos, the future
historian of Mohammed II, who bribed the Turkish Admiral, Hamza,
not to attack the islands and through his mediation managed to send
representatives of the Greek church and the local nobility with a present
to the Sultan’s court at Adrianople, begging him to allow them to be
administered as before. It chanced that at this moment envoys of the
Gattilusj were at Adrianople, for on the fall of Constantinople both
Dorino and Palamede had hastened to placate and congratulate the
terrible Sultan, and to crave the grant of Lemnos and Imbros. Dorino,
although he was still lord of Lesbos in name and continued to sign state
documents, had been bed-ridden since 1449, and his eldest surviving son,
Domenico, governed as regent. Domenico and one of Palamede’s
councillors were supported by the two emissaries of Kritoboulos, and
the Sultan was pleased to confer Lemnos upon the lord of Lesbos,
Imbros upon him of Ænos. At the same time Mohammed ordered the
former to pay an annual tribute of 3000 gold pieces for Lesbos and 2325
for Lemnos; that of Imbros was assessed at 1200 gold pieces. Thus, by
the irony of fate, only nine years before its annihilation, the dominion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
of the Gattilusj reached its greatest extent. Indeed, there was a party
in Skyros also which advocated annexation to Lesbos, but there the
majority wisely preferred the nearer and more powerful lion of St Mark,
which waved over Eubœa<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>.</p>

<p>The Gattilusj were now well aware that they only existed on
sufferance, and they were more careful than ever not to offend their
master. Domenico paid more than one visit of obeisance to the Turkish
court; and when, in June, 1455, the Turkish admiral, on his way to
Rhodes, anchored off Lesbos, the historian Doukas<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>, the prince’s
secretary, was sent on board with a handsome present of garments of
silk and of woven wool six in number, 6000 pieces of silver, 20 oxen,
50 sheep, more than 800 measures of wine, 2 bushels of biscuit and one
of bread, more than 1000 lbs. of cheese, and fruit without measure, as
well as gifts in proportion to their rank for the members of the admiral’s
staff. Under these circumstances, it was no wonder that Hamza treated
the lord of Lesbos “like a brother,” and refrained from entering the
harbour, for fear of alarming the islanders.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Turkish fleet left, when, on June 30, 1455, Dorino I
died, leaving his dominion of Lesbos, Foglia Vecchia, Thasos, and
Lemnos to his eldest surviving son, Domenico, for whom the younger,
Nicolò, acted as governor in the last-named island. Before a month
had passed, the fleet hove in sight of Mytilene on its homeward voyage,
and was invited to anchor in the harbour, where the serviceable Doukas
again visited the admiral, whom he kept in good humour by a sumptuous
banquet and sped on his way with a sigh of relief on the morrow.
But the historian had before him a more delicate mission—that of
paying the annual tribute for Lesbos and Lemnos to Mohammed II.
Starting from Lesbos on August 1, he found the Sultan at Adrianople,
kissed hands in token of homage and remained seated in his presence,
till His Majesty’s morning meal was over. When, however, he went to
hand the money to the Sultan’s ministers next day, they ingeniously
asked him after the health of his master. The historian replied that he
was well and sent his greeting, whereupon the Ottomans answered, that
they meant the old prince. Doukas explained that Dorino had been
dead 40 days, and that his successor had already been practically prince
for six years, during which time he had once or twice come in person
to do homage and congratulate the Great Turk. The ministers thereupon
cut short the conversation with the remark that no one had the
right to assume the title of lord of Lesbos (borne till his death by Dorino),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
until he had come and received his principality from the hands of his
Most Mighty suzerain. “Go therefore,” they said, “and return with thy
master; for if he come not, he knows what the future has in store for
him.” The terrified envoy hastened back to Lesbos, and set out with
Domenico and several leading men of both races in the island to do
homage to Mohammed. The Sultan had, however, meanwhile changed
his headquarters, for the plague was then ravaging Thrace, and it was
not till the Lesbian deputation reached the Bulgarian village of Zlatica
that they came up with him. After the usual <i>bakshîsh</i> to the influential
Pashas, Mahmûd and Said Achmet, they were admitted to the presence,
and Domenico humbly kissed the hand of his suzerain. But on the
morrow a message was conveyed to Domenico, that the Sultan wished
to have the island of Thasos. Argument was useless, and the island,
which had belonged for some 20, or perhaps even 35, years to the
Gattilusj, was ceded to Mohammed. This sacrifice only whetted the
appetite of the Sultan; on the morrow a second message announced that
the tribute for Lesbos would be doubled. At this Domenico plucked up
courage to reply, that, if the Sultan wished to take the whole of Lesbos,
it was in his power to do so; but that to pay twice the previous tribute
was beyond its present ruler’s resources. At the same time, he begged
the Sultan’s ministers to intervene on his behalf. They represented the
facts to their master, and the latter agreed to a compromise, by which
Lesbos should thenceforth pay 4000 gold pieces, instead of 3000. Then,
at last they decked Domenico with a gold-embroidered robe and his
companions with silken garments; the Lesbians signed the oath of
allegiance and set out on their homeward journey, “thanking God, who
had delivered them out of the hands of the monster.”</p>

<p>But the year was not destined to close without further losses to
the Gattilusj. While the deputation was still at Philippopolis, a second
Turkish fleet, under Junis, set out to attack the Genoese colony of Chios.
Off the Troad a storm arose, in which several of the Turkish vessels
perished, while the rest of the fleet, except the flagship, took refuge in
the harbour of Mytilene, where Nicolò was then representing his absent
brother. It had been one of the treaty obligations of the lords of Lesbos,
ever since they had been vassals of the Sultan, to warn the Turks who
inhabited the opposite mainland between the mouth of the Kaïkos and
the town of Assos, of the approach of Catalan corsairs, and the Gattilusj
were bound to pay compensation for any loss caused by negligence in
performing this service. Now it chanced that the scout, employed on
this business, sailed into the harbour while the Turks were there,
followed by the missing Turkish flagship. The admiral, a very different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
man from his predecessor, requited Nicolò Gattilusio’s generous
hospitality by demanding that this vessel with all on board should be
given up to him as a prize, including the wife of a very distinguished
member of the Chian Chartered Company, Paride Giustiniani Longo,
with all her jewelry. The lady in question was none other than Domenico’s
mother-in-law, whom he had invited to Lesbos to keep his wife company
while he was away—for Domenico’s love for his wife was proverbial,
and it is narrated of him that he could never bear to be out of her sight
and even shared her bed when she was afflicted with leprosy. Nicolò
protested that the vessel was his brother’s and that the wealthy Chian
dame had not been on board but had already been long in the island. At
this, the Turkish commander complained to the Sultan, and sailed for
Foglia Nuova, of which Paride Longo was then governor for the Chian
Company. Arrived there, he summoned the governor and the chief men
of the place to appear before him. Such was their alarm, that even
before his summons arrived they had started to meet him, only to hear
the Sultan’s written orders that they should all be imprisoned and their
city levelled with the ground, unless they surrendered the fort. The
citizens, without attempting to argue or reply, at once admitted the
Turks; the Genoese merchants were plundered and led on board; the
names of all the citizens were taken down, about a hundred of their
children carried off, and a Turkish guard placed in the fort. Thus on
October 31, 1455, fell the Genoese colony of Foglia Nuova, the old
possession of the Zaccaria and of the Cattaneo families, and then for a
century a dependency of the <i>maona</i> of Chios.</p>

<p>When Domenico returned home and learnt from his brother what
had occurred, he sent Doukas to plead the case at Constantinople. The
Lesbian envoy’s arguments and appeals to justice were, however, all in
vain; Mohammed gave Domenico the alternative of paying 10,000 gold
pieces or of war; and, when Doukas resisted this monstrous ultimatum,
secretly despatched one of his servants to take Foglia Vecchia, which
had been held by the Gattilusj of Lesbos ever since 1402 at least. This,
their sole possession on the Asian main, was seized on December 24,
1455. As soon as the Sultan received the news of its capture, he ordered
Doukas to be sent away free and declared the question settled. Well
might Domenico, after this experience, write urgently to Genoa for
succour<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the younger branch of the Gattilusj. Palamede<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
of Ænos had died in 1455; and, as his elder son Giorgio had predeceased
him<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> in 1449, he had bequeathed his dominions to his second son,
Dorino II, and to Giorgio’s widow and her children. While Giorgio was
still alive, his father had given him all his estates, except his Lesbian
property, which was the share of Dorino II, and even after Giorgio’s
death, his widow and family had a preference in the old lord’s will, as
representing the first-born. No sooner, however, was Palamede dead
than Dorino, defying the dictates alike of justice and prudence, seized
the whole of the estate. In vain Giorgio’s widow and his own advisers
implored him not to drive her to appeal to the judgment-seat of the
Sultan, his suzerain. Finding her arguments useless, she begged her
uncle to lay her case before Mohammed, and that undiplomatic envoy,
anxious to punish Dorino even at the price of annexation to Turkey,
depicted the usurper as a faithless vassal, who was conspiring with the
Italians, collecting arms, hiring soldiers, and preparing to increase the
garrisons of Ænos and the two islands with the object of proclaiming his
complete independence. His advocacy found a willing hearer, for
Mohammed coveted Ænos because of its favourable situation, on the
estuary of the Maritza, then navigable for a considerable distance,
opposite the islands, of which it was the natural mart, and in close
proximity to the lake of Jala Göl. Thanks to these natural advantages,
to the river and lake fisheries, and above all to its valuable salt-beds,
which supplied all Thrace and Macedonia, Ænos was then a very rich
city, from which Palamede had received 300,000 pieces of silver. It was
true, that two-thirds of the proceeds of the salt-beds and of the other
revenues were already handed over to the Sultan; but it was suggested
by the people of the neighbouring towns of Ipsala and Feredchik that
the Gattilusj did not administer the salt-works honestly, while they gave
refuge at Ænos to fugitive Turkish slaves.</p>

<p>Mohammed resolved to act at once. Despite the terrible Balkan
winter, which made havoc with his troops, he left Constantinople on
January 24, 1456, and marched against Ænos, while Junis with the
fleet menaced it from the sea. Dorino was absent in Samothrace,
whither he had gone to spend the winter in Palamede’s castle; and his
subjects, thus left to themselves, made no attempt at resistance. They
sent a deputation of leading citizens to the Sultan’s headquarters at
Ipsala, and surrendered the city on condition that no harm was done
to its inhabitants. Mohammed received them kindly, granted some of
their requests, and sent Mahmûd Pasha back with them to take over
the town. On the next day he came in person, carried off all the silver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
gold and other valuables, which he found in Dorino’s palace and plundered
the houses of that prince’s absent suite. Then, after a three days’
stay, during which he organised the future administration of the place
and appointed a certain Murad as its governor, he marched away,
taking 150 children, the flower of the youth of Ænos, with him, and
entrusting Junis with the annexation of Samothrace and Imbros, the
maritime dependencies of that city.</p>

<p>The Turkish admiral, on his arrival at Imbros, summoned Kritoboulos
the historian, whose personality and opinions were already well-known
at the Turkish court, and made him governor in the room of
Dorino’s representative, at that time apparently Joannes Laskaris
Rhyndakenos, whom he carried off on board. Meanwhile, a vessel had
been despatched to Samothrace to fetch Dorino. But the latter, mistrusting
the admiral, as he well might, preferred to throw himself upon
the mercy of the Sultan. He therefore manned his yacht, crossed over
to Ænos, and thence proceeded to Adrianople. Mohammed received
him, and promised to restore to him his islands; but the malicious
admiral, indignant at what he considered a slight upon himself, persuaded
his sovereign to give Dorino instead some place on the mainland,
on the ground that the islanders would not tolerate him and that he
would be less able to plot at a distance from the sea. The Sultan thereupon
changed his mind, and granted to the dethroned prince the district
of Zichna in Macedonia. Dorino did not, however, long remain there;
after slaying the Turkish officials, who were his guard of honour, he fled
to Lesbos, and thence to Naxos, where he married his cousin, Elisabetta
Crispo, daughter of the late Duke, Giacomo II, and settled down at the
ducal court<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>.</p>

<p>The Turkish annexation of Samothrace and Imbros and the
appointment of a native governor had an immediate effect upon the
neighbouring island of Lemnos. The Lemnians had had little more than
two years of Gattilusian Government, and the experience had been
unfortunate, for Domenico had entrusted their island to his brother
Nicolò, against whose tyrannical conduct they made secret complaint
to the Sultan, begging him to send one of his servants to rule over them.
Mohammed gladly consented, and ordered Junis’ successor, Ismael, to
sail for Lemnos, and install the amiable Hamza as governor. Before
the Turks arrived, Domenico despatched a small force under Giovanni<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
Fontana and Spineta Colomboto with orders to induce the Lemnians
by promises to return to their allegiance, and failing that to escort his
brother, then encamped behind the walls of Palaiokastro, back to
Lesbos. His emissaries, however, disobeying his orders, resorted to
force, with the result that the islanders routed them with considerable
loss, and those who escaped had to content themselves with conveying
Nicolò home. When the Turkish admiral arrived, he commended the
Lemnians, landed the new governor and returned, in May, 1456, with the
Lesbian prisoners on board, to the Dardanelles. The news of what had
occurred so infuriated Mohammed against Domenico, that when in
August Doukas came with the annual tribute and begged for their
release, he commanded their heads to be cut off, and only repented when
they had actually mounted the scaffold, ordering that they should be
sold, instead of being beheaded<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the seven possessions of the Gattilusj Lesbos now alone remained;
and Genoa, which a few months earlier had been mainly concerned
lest rebellious citizens of the friendly Republic of Ancona should find
shelter in Domenico’s ports, now sent a ship with arms and 200 men to
his aid, purchased cannon and powder on his behalf, and appealed to
Pope Calixtus III and to Kings Alfonso V of Portugal and Henry VI
of England to join in a crusade against the enemy which threatened
him. Meanwhile, the Pope organised a fund for the redemption of the
captives of the two Foglie<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>, plans were laid for the reconquest of the
places lost, and a certain George Dromokaïtes, a noble Greek of Lemnos,
offered to deliver that island and Imbros to Venice<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>. In the autumn of
1456 a papal fleet under the command of Cardinal Scarampi, the
Patriarch of Aquileia, appeared in the Ægean; and, after vain attempts
to make Domenico refuse to pay his tribute and fight, annexed Lemnos
without opposition, thanks to the influence of George Diplovatatzes<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>,
the Greek <i>archon</i> of Kastro, occupied Samothrace, and took Thasos
after an assault upon the harbour fort. Imbros was, however, saved by
the diplomacy of Kritoboulos, its governor, who bribed and flattered
the Cardinal’s lieutenant, a certain “Count,” whom we may identify
with the Count of Anguillara. Garrisons were left in the three conquered
islands, and the papal commander appointed governors in the name of
the Holy Father—for these former possessions of the Gattilusj were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
restored to their lawful owners, but retained by the Holy See. Both the
Venetians and the Catalans in vain begged the Pope to give them the
three islands; but, in 1459, Pius II offered to consign them to the Bank
of St George, which then managed the Genoese colonies, on condition
that it would hold them as his vicar. The papal offer was, however,
unanimously declined, from fear of offending the Sultan, who might
then attack the Black Sea colonies, and from considerations of expense.
Besides, Genoa could scarcely have accepted Lemnos, Thasos and
Samothrace without a breach of good faith towards her own children<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>.</p>

<p>The indignation which Mohammed felt at the capture of the
Thracian islands, he vented upon Domenico. Although Doukas, the
person most likely to know, expressly tells us that the lord of Lesbos
had continued to pay his tribute, and he had certainly not profited by
the losses of his suzerain, nevertheless the Sultan accused him of being
entirely responsible for what had occurred and the Turcophil Kritoboulos
insinuates that he and his brother Nicolò, now resident in Lesbos,
refused to send the usual tribute and harboured corsairs who preyed
upon the opposite coast and plundered Turkish merchantmen. Domenico
was, however, himself a sufferer from these raids, and had begged the
Pope to excommunicate the pirates who had injured his subjects. But
Mohammed was doubtless glad of an excuse for attacking Lesbos, and
in August, 1457, sent Ismael, his admiral, with a large fleet against it.
Ismael landed at Molivos, the scene of a former Turkish defeat; and,
after ravaging all the countryside, besieged the castle. Such was the
terror, inspired by the Turks, that a detachment of the papal fleet,
which had been sent under a certain “Sergius,” perhaps Raymond de
Siscar, to the relief of Lesbos, at once weighed anchor for Chios. But
the garrison of Molivos resisted with such courage, that the Turkish
commander was forced to retire on August 9 with much loss, after
venting his rage on the defenceless portions of the island. As soon as
he had gone, the papal lieutenant returned, only to be greeted with
reproaches by the justly indignant Gattilusj. The Pope, indeed, described
Lesbos as “Our island” and calmly stated that he had only
allowed its lord to retain it on condition that he recognised the authority
of the Holy See. But Domenico wrote to the “Office of Mytilene”—a
body which then existed in Genoa for the promotion of trade with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
Lesbos—stating frankly that he could hold out no longer unless Genoa
helped him, and threatening, that, in case of her refusal, he must
perforce submit to some other rule. Meanwhile, he sent envoys to the
Sultan to pay his tribute and obtain peace. The Bank of St George
assured him that it would not desert him, and decided to appoint a
committee of four shareholders in the Chian Chartered Company and
two other Chians, who should raise 300 soldiers for the defence of Lesbos
at the Bank’s expense. A new duty on merchandise exported to Chios
was to defray the equipment of these men; their pay was to be provided
by Domenico, if possible; or, if he could not find the ready money, he
was to mortgage his property as security. Genoa was none too generous
to her outpost in the Levant; she calculated her Lesbian policy by the
maxims of the counting-house<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>.</p>

<p>Domenico did not, however, live to fall by the hands of the Turks.
He had a more sinister enemy in his own household. So long as Nicolò
had been able to gratify his love of power at the expense of the unhappy
Lemnians, he was harmless to his brother; but, when his intractable
disposition had estranged the sympathies of the governed and caused
the loss of that island, the two brothers were both restricted to Lesbos,
the sole fragment of the Gattilusian dominions that remained. Nicolò
was quarrelsome and ambitious; he chafed at the inferior position which
he occupied, and resolved to usurp Domenico’s place. Accordingly,
with the assistance of his cousin, Luchino, and a Genoese named
Baptista (possibly the Baptista Gattilusio, who is described as a very
influential person at Lesbos 14 years earlier<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>), he deposed his elder
brother towards the end of 1458, and threw him into prison, on the
pretext that he was plotting to surrender the island to the Turks.
Soon afterwards the usurper strangled his prisoner, having, according
to one account, first cut off his arms so that he could no longer embrace
the faithful wife who still clung to him<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>. Her father demanded from the
murderer repayment of the sums which Domenico had received as her
dowry and of those which he had subsequently borrowed; and the
Doge of Genoa threatened the lord of Lesbos with the forcible intervention
of the Republic unless he liquidated these debts<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>. The fate of
the widow is unknown; more fortunate, however, in one respect than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
other ill-fated heroines of Frankish Greece, she has given her name to
the only modern poem, based upon the mediæval history of Sappho’s
island, while her bust by Mino da Fiesole is in the National Museum at
Florence<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>.</p>

<p>The fratricide’s position was, indeed, unenviable. The papal fleet
had returned to Italy upon the death of Calixtus III in the summer
of 1458, leaving the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes as vicar
of the three Thracian islands, and the new Pope, Pius II, was too busy
with the internal politics of that country to provide for their defence,
which the Bank of St George did not think it prudent to undertake,
but contented himself with founding a new Order of the Knights of
St Mary of Bethlehem with its seat at Lemnos<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>. Thus inadequately
defended by the Italians and terrified at the possible advent of the
Turkish fleet, the islanders had no option but to submit to the Sultan.
Lemnos set the example. In the winter of 1458-9, Kritoboulos, ever
ready to do the work of the Turk, entered into secret negotiations with
the Lemnian leaders for the surrender of their island. The Greeks were
nothing loth, for they found the papal yoke irksome, as it must naturally
have been to “schismatics,” and above all they feared the vengeance of
Mohammed. The Imbriote diplomatist thereupon wrote to Demetrios
Palaiologos, the Despot of Mistra, suggesting that this was the moment
to crave Lemnos and Imbros from the Sultan, which the Despot had
already coveted as a peaceful retreat, and offering to drive the Italians
out of the former island. Demetrios at once sent Matthew Asan, his
brother-in-law, whose family was, as we saw, connected with Imbros,
to ask Mohammed for the two islands. The Sultan consented, on condition
that Demetrios paid 3000 gold pieces as tribute for them, and it
then devolved upon Kritoboulos to carry out his mission. Evading
the Italian guard-ships, he landed in Lemnos; his confederates at Kastro
opened the gates of that fortress; the townsfolk of Kokkinos shut up
the small Italian garrison in the public offices, till it surrendered unconditionally,
whereupon Kritoboulos told them that they could go or
stay as they pleased, and sent their Calabrian commander with presents
to Eubœa. The fort of Palaiokastro, the strongest in the island, alike
by its natural position and its triple wall of huge stones, contained
provisions for a year and was commanded by a young and resolute
soldier, named Michele. When Michele received a summons to surrender,
his sole reply was a sword, drawn in blood, and an invitation to Kritoboulos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
to come and take the castle by force, if he were a man. He could
not, however, trust the Greeks in the town below, whose vines and fields
Kritoboulos was careful to respect; and, when he saw the superior forces
drawn up against him, he begged for three months’ grace, till he had
time to communicate with the Grand Master at Rhodes, the papal vicar
of the islands. Later on, he surrendered Palaiokastro for 1000 gold
pieces, and in 1460, after the Turkish conquest of the Morea, Lemnos
and Imbros were bestowed by the Sultan upon the dispossessed Despot,
Demetrios.</p>

<p>The other two islands shared the fate of Lemnos. In the autumn
of 1459, Zaganos, Ismael’s successor in the command of the Turkish
fleet, captured both Thasos and Samothrace, cutting to pieces the Catalan
garrison placed by Scarampi in the former, and removing Thasians and
Samothracians alike to recolonise Constantinople. In the following
year the Sultan bestowed these two islands also, together with Ænos,
upon Demetrios Palaiologos, who thus became the heir of the Gattilusj
in Thrace and the four maritime dependencies<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>. In vain, Pius II urged
Rhyndakenos, the former prefect of the Gattilusj, to release Samothrace
from its captivity. In vain, he gave Turkish Imbros to Alexander Asan<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>.</p>

<p>About the time that Lemnos fell, the learned Leonardo of Chios,
who had held the Archiepiscopal see of Lesbos since 1444 and was on
very intimate terms with the reigning family, was sent to ask the aid
of Christendom for that sole remaining island. The Genoese Government
early in 1459 appealed to the Christian Powers and more especially
to Charles VII of France, whose viceroy, the Duke of Calabria, was then
administering Genoa, reminding them of the recent attack of the Turks
upon Lesbos, of the exiguous resources of its lord, and of the impossibility
in which the exhausted Genoese now found themselves of supporting
him without external assistance, as they had done before, against
another and more serious invasion. The fall of Lesbos, it was added,
might encourage the Sultan to direct his arms against Italy. Unfortunately
this appeal met with no response. Indeed, one of the Christian
Powers, England, was at that moment greatly incensed with the
Gattilusj, owing to the piracies of Giuliano, a celebrated corsair of that
family, whose depredations on the merchants of Bristol had caused the
arrest of all the Genoese in the country and the confiscation of their
goods. Accordingly, the Genoese Government, which had been glad to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
make use of him as a cousin, when it seemed convenient, now repudiated
him as a Greek and an alien. The proceedings of this illegitimate descendant
of Francesco II formed the subject of letters to Henry VI, to
the Chancellor and the Privy Seal, to the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, to John Viscount Beaumont, the Great Chamberlain, and
Humphry Duke of Buckingham. Indeed, it was owing to Giuliano
Gattilusio, that “the office of English affairs” was founded at Genoa<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>.</p>

<p>The new lord of Lesbos, as one Christian state after another fell,
became more urgent in his requests for help, for he knew that even
the payment of tribute would not save him. In 1460 he begged that
the former practice might be revived of having a board of four commissioners
in Chios, who could send 300 men to the relief of Lesbos,
whenever the Sultan was preparing to attack it. It was decided to
re-constitute this board, but not to impose any new duty for defraying
the expense, and a certain number of men from Camogli on the Riviera
di Levante were hired for the defence of Lesbos. Towards the close of
1461, he wrote imploring the Republic not to forget him in his distress.
But, although the French had then been expelled from Genoa, and
Lodovico de Campo-fregoso, husband of Nicolò’s first-cousin, Ginevra
Gattilusio, was once more Doge, all the reply that he received was fair
words, a futile assertion that in the season of 1462 the Turk would be
occupied by land rather than at sea, and a promise to promote a good
understanding between Lesbos and the Chartered Company of Chios,
which was apt to forget the common danger in the private quarrels of
its members—an allusion to the still outstanding dispute between
Nicolò and Paride Longo. Weakened by faction at home, divided by
rival interests abroad, the Genoese allowed Lesbos to succumb<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.</p>

<p>Mohammed’s conquest of Serbia, Greece, and Trebizond and his
campaign in Wallachia had given Nicolò a brief respite, which he had
wisely employed in strengthening the fortifications of his island-capital
by deepening the moats and heightening the ramparts. To this may
be referred his Latin inscription<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> in the castle, dated 1460. But on
September 1, 1462, the long-threatened Turkish fleet hove in sight under
the command of Mahmûd Pasha, himself a Greek, while the Sultan at
the head of the land forces advanced across the plain of Troy, the sight
of which is said to have inspired him with the belief that he was the
chosen avenger of the Trojans upon the descendants of their conquerors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
Mohammed had no difficulty in finding plausible excuses for his invasion
of Lesbos. The island had become a receptacle of Catalan pirates, who
issued thence to ravage the Turkish coast and returned thither to divide
their prisoners, assigning a goodly proportion to their patron. A
reluctance to pay his tribute and a secret understanding with the
Italians formed further accusations against him, and Mohammed chose
to regard himself as the instrument of the Almighty for the punishment
of the Lesbian fratricide.</p>

<p>The great Turkish fleet, variously estimated at 67, 110, 125, 150,
and even 200 sail, cast anchor in the old harbour of St George, whither
Nicolò’s envoys went to enquire the justification of this attack upon an
island, whose lords had paid, ever since the death of Dorino I seven
years before, an annual tribute of 7000 gold ducats of Venice. Mahmûd
replied, that his master wanted the castle and island of Mytilene—a
demand repeated by the Sultan himself, when he crossed over from the
mainland, with the addition that he would grant Nicolò a sufficient
estate elsewhere. Nicolò replied, that he could not yield, except to
force, whereupon Mohammed allowed himself to be persuaded by
Mahmûd to return to the opposite coast, lest the Venetian fleet, then at
Chios, to which Nicolò had appealed for help, should arrive and shut
him up in the island. Thereupon the Greek renegade began the siege of
the capital, whose walls contained more than 20,000 non-combatants,
men, women and children, and were garrisoned by over 5000 soldiers,
including 70 knights of Rhodes and 110 Catalan mercenaries from
Chios.</p>

<p>After four days’ skirmishing, which resulted in a number of the
Latins being cut off from the city and cut up by the Turks, the besiegers
landed six large cannon, whose shot weighed more than 700 lbs. apiece,
and planted them in favourable positions for bombarding the city—three
at the soap works only a stone’s throw from the walls, one at
St Nicholas’, another at St Bonne’s<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> near the place of public execution,
and the sixth in the suburbs opposite a barbican tower, defended by a
monk and a knight of Rhodes. Protected by a barrier of large stones
from the fire of the besieged, the Turkish batteries did great execution.
The tower of the Virgin and the adjacent walls were pounded till they
were nothing but a mass of ruins; the cannon of St Nicholas’ riddled the
tower of the harbour, built long before by a Gallego named Pedro de
Laranda, so that no one durst defend it, and it fell on the eighth day
into the hands of the Turks, whose red flags floated from its riven battlements.
The besiegers then concentrated their efforts on the lower castle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
called Melanoudion, and commanded by Luchino Gattilusio, who had
helped Nicolò to the throne, and whose neglect caused the loss of this
important position. It was proposed by the wiser members of his staff
to set fire to the lower castle, as they had already burnt to the water’s
edge their ships in the harbour, rather than that it should be taken by
the Turks and used as a base for attacking the upper citadel. But
Luchino boasted that he could hold the fort, and actually held it for five
days, although the Turks once climbed the walls and carried off in
triumph an Aragonese flag which had been planted there by the Catalan
corsairs. At last a force of 20,000 men carried Melanoudion by storm,
drove the defenders “like locusts” into the upper castle, and destroyed
all that they found. Terrified and breathless, with his naked sword in
his hand, Luchino rushed into the midst of the Italians, who had taken
refuge in the upper castle, and his narrative struck them with such terror
that they resolved to surrender. According to one account, Luchino
and the commander of the city had intentionally made further resistance
impossible by betraying to Mahmûd the weak points of the defences,
and by then urging Nicolò to yield and to save their heads and property.
The panic was increased by one huge mortar, whose heavy projectiles
destroyed houses and the women inside and drove the terrified defenders
from the walls to take shelter from a similar fate. Heavy sums had to be
offered, to induce men to repair the breaches; while many, in their
despair, flew to drink, and broke into the vast stores of wine and provisions,
which, if the garrison had been properly led, would have enabled
Mytilene to resist a whole year’s siege. But, though well provided with
food and engines of war, the place lacked a brave and experienced soldier,
who would have inspired the garrison with enthusiasm. Another council
was held, and two envoys were sent to inform Mahmûd, that the inhabitants
were ready to become his master’s vassals, if their heads and
remaining property were guaranteed. The Turkish commander drew up
a memorandum of the terms in writing, and swore by his girded sword
and his sovereign’s head that no harm should befall them. The Sultan,
on hearing the news, re-crossed to Lesbos, and a janissary was ordered
to conduct Nicolò to his presence. Thither the last Latin lord of Lesbos
proceeded with two horsemen, kissed the feet of his new master and
tearfully handed to Mohammed the keys of the city, which the Gattilusj
had held for well-nigh eleven decades. At the same time he pleaded that
he had never violated his oaths, never harboured Turkish slaves, but
had at once restored them to their owners; and, if he had perforce
received pirates to save his own land from their ravages, he had never
furnished them with the means of injuring that of the Turks. It was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
he added, the fault of his subjects that he had not accepted the Sultan’s
generous offer at once, and “I now,” he concluded with tears, “surrender
the city and island, begging that my lord may reward me for my good
disposition in the past towards him.” Mohammed censured him for his
past ingratitude, but promised that it should not be remembered against
him. Forthwith a <i>subashi</i> and two men took possession of the upper
castle, whence the Frankish garrison was removed but no one else was
allowed to issue. The conquerors celebrated their success by a Bacchanalian
orgie and by burning the still standing houses of Melanoudion,
while the Sultan, setting on one side the chief men among the Franks,
bade saw asunder with exquisite cruelty some 300 of the others as pirates
in one of the suburbs. Thus, it was said, he had literally carried out their
conditions, that their heads should be spared.</p>

<p>The other fortresses in the island—Molivos (or Augerinos), the
castle of the two SS. Theodores, and Eresos—now surrendered; for the
wretched Nicolò, by the Sultan’s commands, sent a notary with
instructions under his own seal, ordering his officers to open their gates.
The countryfolk were left undisturbed, but any suspects found there
were removed; and later on, one or two of these places were destroyed,
and their inhabitants transported, like those of the Foglie, to Constantinople.
On the second day after the occupation of the capital, a
herald summoned all the citizens to file past the Sultan’s pavilion one
by one. On September 17 the sorrowful procession took place; three
clerks noted down the names of each, of the most pleasing maidens and
the children several hundreds were picked out, and the rest of the
population was divided into three classes—the worthless were left
behind in the city, others were sold by public auction on the beach, and
others again driven on board ship like so many sheep, to await slavery
and fill the gaps at Constantinople. But of the 10,000 and more who
were shipped from Lesbos a part perished on the overcrowded ships; and
with brutal, if business-like precision, all disputes as to the ownership
of these human cattle were obviated by cutting off the right ear of each
corpse, before it was flung into the deep, and removing the victim’s
name from the list. Some 200 janissaries and 300 infantry were left to
garrison the city under Ali Bestami, a man of great courage and learning.</p>

<p>The fleet, bearing Nicolò, Luchino, the Archbishop Leonardo, and
the rest of the captives, reached Constantinople on October 16, where
some of them received houses, or sites in one quarter of the city. The
two Gattilusj, however, were soon afterwards imprisoned in the “tower
of the French.” Mohammed disliked Nicolò for what he had done in
the past, and the <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> of the capital attributed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
feelings to the fact that a lad attached to the Turkish court had fled
to Lesbos, abandoned Islâm, and become the favourite of Nicolò. After
the fall of Lesbos, this youth was sent as a present to the Sultan, and
recognised by his comrades, who told their master and thus rekindled
his indignation. The two prisoners, to save their lives and regain their
freedom, offered to abjure Christianity, and were duly circumcised,
gorgeously apparelled by the Sultan, and set free. But their liberty did
not last long; they were again imprisoned, and executed, Nicolò being
strangled with a bow-string, as he had strangled his own brother. His
lovely sister Maria, widow of the Emperor Alexander of Trebizond,
whom Mohammed had previously captured in Kolchis, entered the
seraglio; her only son became one of the Conqueror’s favourite pages.</p>

<p>Thus ended the rule of the Gattilusj in Lesbos. Had Nicolò been
bolder, had Genoa given more help, had Venice not played the part of
a spectator, the island might have been saved, or at least its capture
postponed. At the time of the siege, Vettor Capello was at Chios, and,
in answer to Nicolò’s appeal, actually set out with 29 galleys towards
Lesbos; but, although he could have burnt the Turkish fleet in the
absence of its crews, he durst not disobey his instructions, which were
to avoid giving any offence to the Sultan. Even after the capture of
Mytilene, when the people of the castle of the two SS. Theodores begged
him to accept them as Venetian subjects, he refused. Later on, when war
broke out with Turkey, Venice repented her inaction, and tried in vain
to make reparation for it. Even Genoa took the “calamity of Mytilene”
with philosophy<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>.</p>

<p>Christendom did not, however, abandon all hope of recovering what
the Gattilusj had lost. The learned Archbishop of Lesbos, a second time
the prisoner of the Turks, wrote to Pius II, as he had written to Nicholas V
after the capture of Constantinople, a letter describing the sufferings
of his flock and begging the Pope to make peace in Italy and war upon
“the Cerberus” of the East. Pius responded by planning a new crusade,
and the Genoese suggested that its first stage should be the recapture
of Lesbos<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>. The Pope’s death ended his plans; but early in 1464 a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
Venetian fleet under Luigi Loredano occupied Lemnos with the assistance
of a Moreote pirate, who bore the great name of Comnenos. This
man had descended upon the island some time before with two galleys,
had captured it from the officials who were governing it for Demetrios
Palaiologos, and had established his authority over the citadel and the
old city of Lemnos. But the pirate saw that he was not strong enough
to hold his conquest single-handed, and therefore transferred it to the
maritime Republic, which thence easily extended her sway over the rest
of the island. Venice retained Lemnos for 15 years, and five Venetian
nobles successively administered, with the title of “Rector,” this
distant outpost<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>. In April of the same year Orsato Giustiniano, Loredano’s
successor, laid siege to Mytilene, but, after six weeks spent before
the walls and two battles, in which the Venetians sustained heavy losses,
on the approach of the Turkish fleet withdrew to Eubœa with all the
Christian islanders whom he could convey, only returning to SS. Theodores
to remove a second cargo. Giustiniano died of grief at his failure,
and the Turkish sway over Lesbos, despite three subsequent attempts,
had never been broken till the Greek fleet took the island on November
22, 1912<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>.</p>

<p>Two years later Vettor Capello obtained Imbros, Thasos, and Samothrace
for Venice<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>, and Bernardo Natale was sent as Rector to the last-named
island. Imbros was, however, retaken by the Turks in 1470,
owing to the unpopularity and incapacity of that official<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>. Lemnos
resisted more than one Turkish attack; in view of its importance as a
station for the fleet, Venice sent 200 <i>stradioti</i> to settle there, restored
the walls of Kokkinos, and strengthened the fortifications of Palaiokastro,
while Mohammed made its cession a condition of peace. At last
this island, then inhabited by 6000 souls, or twice the population of
Imbros, after having won romantic fame by the exploits of its heroic
defender, the virgin Marulla, was ceded to Turkey by the peace<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> of
1479. At the same time, Samothrace with its 200 islanders, and Thasos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
neither of them mentioned since their capture in 1466, were probably
surrendered, and the whole of the Gattilusj’s former realm was thus
irrevocably Turkish till 1912, with the exception of the Venetian
occupation of Lemnos in 1656/7, and of the Russian occupation of part
of that island in 1770—for Ænos, although laid in ashes by Nicolò
da Canale in 1468, had not been occupied by the Venetians, and Foglia
Vecchia had repulsed his attack<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.</p>

<p>Even after this apparently final Turkish conquest, one member of
the family continued to cherish the remote hope that one day his
ancestral dominions might be reconquered. Dorino II of Ænos was still
alive at Genoa, and in 1488, as the sole representative of both branches
of the Gattilusj—for Nicolò II had left no children—granted to his
brother-in-law, Marco d’Oria, all his rights to their possessions in the
Levant. It was agreed, that, should Lesbos be recovered—as was
hoped, by the aid of the King of France—Dorino should nevertheless
have his father’s former estates in that island, unless Ænos, Foglia
Vecchia, Thasos and Samothrace were also recovered, in which case he
should be entitled to Ænos, Thasos and Samothrace alone and have no
claim to the Lesbian property<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>. Dorino II died childless, the last
legitimate male of his race; but the pirate Giuliano, whose depredations
continued to vex the Genoese Government<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>, had progeny. Among his
descendants were perhaps the Hector Gattilusio<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> whom we find receiving
a small pension from Pope Innocent VIII, and the Stefano Gattilusio<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>,
who was bishop of Melos in 1563. Other Gattilusj occur at Naxos in
the seventeenth century, and the name is reported to exist still not
only there but at Smyrna and Athens<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>, although the family is extinct at
Genoa. Nine years ago a London lady claimed the Byzantine Empire as
a descendant of the Palaiologoi through the Gattilusj. The family church
at Sestri Ponente<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> was ceded by Dorino II to two other persons in 1483.</p>

<p>The rule of the Gattilusj has been described by a modern Greek
writer as more favourable to his fellow-countrymen than that of other
Frankish rulers. Chalkokondyles<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> praises the excellence of their administration,
and one alone of them, the fratricide Nicolò, seems to have
been unpopular. Hellenized by intermarriage with the Imperial houses
of Byzantium and Trebizond, and proud to quarter the arms of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
Palaiologoi with their own, they spoke Greek in the first generation,
and thus early came to understand the feelings of their subjects, who
scarcely regarded them as foreigners, certainly not as foreign conquerors.
Two extant Greek letters of Dorino I and Domenico attest their
familiarity with the language of their people. Moreover, they were not
so much feudal lords as prosperous merchant princes, whose wealth is
attested not only by the sums lent by Francesco II and Nicolò I, but
by the extensive coinage of the Lesbian line. Coins of at least five of
the lords of Mytilene are extant, while Dorino I, whose appanage was
Foglia Vecchia before he succeeded to Lesbos, struck money for that
emporium also<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>. Yet these Genoese nobles took an interest alike in
history, literature, and archæology. Kanaboutzes wrote his commentary
on Dionysios for Palamede; in 1446, the year of Cyriacus’ visit, Leonardo
of Chios, the most famous of Lesbian divines, who owed his appointment
to the patronage of Maria Gattilusio and was selected to accompany
the papal legate, Cardinal Isidore, to Constantinople<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>, wrote at the
bidding of Dorino I’s brother, Luchino, his <i>Treatise concerning true
nobility against Poggio</i>. This quaint tract took the form of a Platonic
dialogue with Luchino in the presence of the Duke of the Archipelago,
and gives us a pretty picture of Lesbian society at the time. “The
prince,” we read, “protects religion; his senate is wise, his soldiers
distinguished, and he lives in splendid state among his lovely halls, his
gardens, his fish-ponds, and his groves.” The drama, if we may argue
from the presence of an actor named Theodoricus, was patronised by
Dorino<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>. Life in Lesbos must therefore have been pleasant, if it had
not been lived on the edge of the Turkish volcano. But even in the last
years of the Gattilusj the numbers of the Latins cannot have been
large, for Calixtus III united the Archiepiscopal see of Methymna with
that of Mytilene, and in 1456 the revenues which Leonardo derived
from both together did not exceed 150 gold florins<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>.</p>

<p>The Genoese sway over Lesbos and the Thracian islands has gone
the way of all Latin rule in the Levant, of which it was so favourable
a specimen. A few inscriptions, a few coats of arms, here and there
a ruined fortress, still remind the now emancipated Greeks of their last
Italian rulers.</p>

</div>

<p>From the second half of the fifteenth down to the close of the
seventeenth century, a large portion of what now forms the kingdom
of Greece formed an integral part of the Turkish Empire, and from the
second part of the sixteenth century some of the Ionian Islands and a
few of the Cyclades were alone exempt from the common lot of Hellas.
Thus, for the first time since the Frank conquest, a dead level of
uniformity, broken only by the privileges of certain communities,
prevailed in place of the feudal principalities, whose fortunes occupied
the annals of the previous two centuries and more. Greece, so often
divided against herself, had found unity in the death of her independence;
and the victorious Turks, like the conquering Romans, had obliterated
the divisions and the liberties of the Greek States at the same moment.
Once more the whole Greek world, with few exceptions, depended upon
a foreign ruler, whose capital was at Constantinople, and whose officials,
like those of the Byzantine Emperors, administered the affairs of his
Greek subjects. There is, however, a considerable difference between
the two periods into which the Turkish government of Greece was
divided. During the first period, down to the Venetian conquest of the
Morea, towards the close of the seventeenth century, Turkey was a
flourishing and conquering Power—a danger to Europe, and a strong
State. During the second period, from the Turkish re-conquest of the
Morea down to the close of the War of Independence, Turkey was
declining, slowly but surely, in all save the one art which she has never
lost even in her political dotage, the art of fighting. For, like the Roman
and the Briton, the Turk has ever been a good soldier, but, unlike those
two great unintellectual peoples, many of whose qualities he shares, he
has never been a good administrator; even when his arrangements have
been excellent in theory, as they often are, they have frequently proved
to be miserable in practice.</p>

<p>The political organisation of Greece under the Turks was indeed
comparatively simple. Before the conquest of the Ægean Islands all
their Greek dominions were comprised within the jurisdiction of the
<i>beglerbeg</i> (“lord of lords”) of Rumili, who resided at Sofia<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>, and were
divided into seven <i>sandjaks</i>, so called from the “flag” which was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
emblem of each large territorial sub-division, and which recalled the
essentially military character of all Turkish arrangements. These seven
<i>sandjaks</i>, after the year 1470, when the capture of Eubœa rounded off
the Greek conquests of Mohammed II, were Salonika, Negroponte,
Trikkala, Lepanto, Karlili, Joannina, and the Morea. Negroponte
included not only the island of Eubœa, but also Bœotia, and Attica.
Its capital was Chalkis, and Athens, Thebes and Livadia, were among
its principal cities. Karlili comprehended Ætolia and Akarnania, as
well as Prevesa, and derived its name from Carlo II Tocco, whose
dominions there had fallen to the Turks. The capital of the Morea
fluctuated between Corinth, Leondari, and Mistra, down to 1540, when
the capture of Nauplia from the Venetians made that place the residence
of the Turkish Pasha. In 1574, when the conclusion of the war of Cyprus
had practically extinguished Latin rule in the Levant, a different
arrangement obtained. Salonika, Trikkala, Joannina, Patras and Mistra
formed five <i>sandjaks</i> under the <i>beglerbeg</i> of Rumili; while the capitan
pasha, in his capacity of <i>beglerbeg</i> “of the sea,” ruled over the seven
insular <i>sandjaks</i> of Lemnos, Lesbos, Rhodes, Chios, the former Duchy
of Naxos (except a few islands bestowed on the favourite Sultana),
Santa Maura (with Prevesa), and Negroponte, besides the three maritime
<i>sandjaks</i> of Nauplia, Lepanto and Kavalla. And, after the conquest of
Crete, three more <i>sandjaks</i>, named from Candia, Rethymno, and Canea,
were carved out of “the great Greek island<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>.”</p>

<p>Each <i>sandjak</i> was in turn sub-divided into a number of <i>cazas</i>, or
sub-districts, of which there were twenty-three in the Morea. It is now
supposed that from 1470 to about 1610, Athens was the chief place of
a <i>caza</i> of the <i>sandjak</i> of Negroponte. Just as each <i>sandjak</i> was governed
by a Pasha or <i>sandjak-beg</i>, so each <i>caza</i> was administered by a lesser
magnate known as a <i>voivode</i> or <i>subashi</i>, who was assisted by a judge,
or <i>cadi</i>.</p>

<p>True to the Turkish feuded system, which had been organised in
Thessaly at the end of the fourteenth century, and extended to Akarnania
and Ætolia on the fall of the Tocchi, Mohammed II distributed Central
Greece and the Morea in fiefs to his veteran warriors. These fiefs were
of two sorts: the larger fief, known as a <i>zaimet</i>, entailed upon the holder
the obligation to provide fifteen horsemen; the smaller, called a <i>timar</i>,
involved the equipment of only two<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. The standard of the <i>sandjak-beg</i>
formed the rallying point of all these feudal chiefs and their horsemen
in case of need. About the middle of the seventeenth century the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
area of the present Greek kingdom on the mainland, including Negroponte
but without Macedonia and Thrace, was portioned out into 267
<i>zaimets</i> and 1625 <i>timars</i>, so that they would represent a force of 7255
horsemen.</p>

<p>Crete, after its conquest, was similarly parcelled out into seventeen
<i>zaimets</i> and 2550 <i>timars</i>, which would produce 5355 cavalry. At first
the timariot system was not in the nature of an hereditary aristocracy.
The <i>timars</i> were originally life-rents only, conferred for services rendered
to the Sultan upon veteran warriors, who might be called upon to appear
with their retainers at the call of their liege lord. In the golden age of
Turkish administration—if such a phrase can be applied to any Turkish
institution—the son of <i>timariot</i> was entrusted with a large fief such as
his sire had held only after he had proved his capacity as the holder of
a small one. But, like all political systems, the Turkish began by making
capacity the sole test of office, and ended by making office the reward
of favourites. Gradually the <i>beglerbeg</i> was allowed to bestow these fiefs,
which had formerly been in the Sultan’s gift, and that official naturally
rewarded his own creatures, just as a British Prime Minister, allowed
by weak or preoccupied monarchs to dispense patronage at his will,
bestows the honours of the peerage and the baronetage upon subservient,
or perhaps recalcitrant, supporters. Thus, in the second half of the
seventeenth century, it was the custom of Romania that, if a holder
of a <i>zaimet</i> or <i>timar</i> died in the wars, his fief was divided into as many
portions as he had sons, unless the rent was no more than 3000 aspers,
in which case the whole went to the eldest son. But if the holder died
in his bed, his lands fell to the <i>beglerbeg</i>, who could bestow them upon
the dead man’s heirs, give them to any of his own servants, or sell them,
as he pleased<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>.</p>

<p>The Turks did not interfere with the Greek municipal system, which
had existed for centuries before the Ottoman conquest. As far back as
the Byzantine times we find that the Hellenic communities employed
representatives, not necessarily drawn from their own members, at the
Imperial Court at Constantinople. Thus, in the eleventh century,
Michael Psellos represented the Ægean Islands at the capital<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>; but, in
some cases, instead of having a permanent representative, whose
functions may be compared with those of the agents-general of our self-governing
colonies, a local deputation occasionally visited Constantinople
to lay its grievances before the central authorities. In the Venetian
island of Tenos a similar practice prevailed; there a committee was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
selected from among the primates to watch over the administration of
the Venetian officials. The Turks, like the Romans, were quite willing
that their Greek subjects should continue to enjoy local self-government.
Accordingly, they allowed the communes to promote commerce and
found schools, while Greek naturally continued to be the official
language of the communal authorities. There was no hard and fast
rule for their election, and no stereotyped title by which they were
known all over Greece. But, generally speaking, every town and even
every hamlet had its own Greek officials, elected by the Christian
inhabitants, or by some portion of them, in a more or less indirect
fashion, and variously styled “elders of the parish,” “elders,” <i>archontes</i>,
“primates,” or, in Turkish, <i>khodja-bashis</i>. Thus, at a late period of the
Ottoman domination, in the island of Psara the whole community met
annually for the election of forty electors, who in turn elected four
“elders of the parish”; at the same period, in the island of Spetsai, the
five “primates” were elected annually by the ships’ captains and the
well-to-do citizens; while Hydra, during a large part of the eighteenth
century, was administered by its priests, with whom two laymen were
associated. The Morea had certain special municipal privileges. It was
permitted to send two or three “primates” to Constantinople, who were
able to mitigate the exactions of the Turkish Pashas by the influence
which they acquired during their stay there. Moreover, each province of
the peninsula used to send two prominent Greeks once or twice a year to
the seat of the Pasha to confer with him upon the affairs of the Morea.
Sometimes, both there and in Thessaly, municipal office descended as a
heritage from father to son, and too often the feuds, which continued to
distinguish the Moreote <i>archontes</i>, descended, with their dignities, to their
descendants. Their duties were to administer the local affairs of their
communities, to act as arbitrators in civil cases, to levy local rates, to
manage the local treasury, and to act as protectors and advisers of the
oppressed. Sometimes they carried out this last duty without flinching,
sometimes, however, their conduct earned them the name of “a kind of
Christian Turks<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>.”</p>

<p>Both the law of Islâm and the laws of human nature forbade the
wholesale conversion of the conquered to the faith of the conquerors.
But Mohammed II, who spoke Greek and knew the Greeks well,
recognised, like the wise statesman that he was, the possibility of
managing his Christian subjects through the medium of their own
Church. The Turks were a foreign garrison in a hostile country, and in
the middle of the fifteenth century it was quite possible that some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
Catholic power might undertake a new crusade for the deliverance of
the East. The bitter hatred of the Eastern for the Western Church
provided the astute Sultan with a powerful incentive for the toleration
and even patronage of the Orthodox religion. He saw that, if he favoured
the one branch of Christendom, he would prevent its union with the
other, and he made a most politic selection of an instrument for the
accomplishment of his plan. One of the strongest opponents of the union
had been Georgios Scholarios, a man of great influence with the Orthodox
and of equal unpopularity with the Catholics. As soon as Constantinople
had fallen, the Sultan caused diligent search to be made for this uncompromising
champion of Orthodoxy, and about the end of the same
year gave orders for his election as Œcumenical Patriarch, according to
the time-honoured forms which the Byzantine Empire had recognised
for centuries. Gennadios II, as the new Patriarch was styled, was
invited to a banquet by the Sultan, who showed him the greatest
attention, and accompanied him as far as the courtyard of the palace,
where he assisted him to mount his horse. A <i>berat</i> of the Sultan determined
the position, powers, and privileges of Gennadios and his
successors. The Œcumenical Patriarch was declared to be “untaxable
and irremovable,” and the document, of which only a summary has
come down to us in the history of Phrantzes<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>, is said to have prohibited
the conversion of Christian churches into mosques. The loss of the
original <i>berat</i> is of less importance because subsequent rescripts modified
these notable concessions, while in practice the privileges of the Patriarch
came to be far less respected than in theory. To him was assigned the
supreme administration of all churches and monasteries, the right of
deposing archbishops and bishops, and the highest criminal jurisdiction
over all the clergy. He decided all matrimonial questions, and other
suits, in which the parties, being both Christians, preferred his judgment
to that of the Turkish courts. He could levy dues for the needs of the
Church on laity and clergy alike, and it was provided that existing
ecclesiastical property should be respected, and that no Christian should
be forced to embrace Islâm. But in these respects, as well as with regard
to the fiscal exemption and irremovability of the Patriarch, the
ecclesiastical history of the Greeks under the Turks shows us a gradual
falling off from the original intentions of Mohammed II. A later <i>berat</i>
laid it down that the Patriarch could be deposed for one of three reasons—oppression
of his flock, transgression of the ecclesiastical law, and
treason towards his sovereign—elastic terms, capable of a wide interpretation.
Mohammed II himself deposed the Patriarch Joseph I, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
refusing to sanction the marriage of the widow of the last Duke of
Athens with George Amoiroutses, the traitor who had been accused of
handing over Trebizond to the Turks, and who had a wife still living.
From the Turkish conquest to the present day 69 Patriarchs have been
deposed, several more than once, 20 were thus removed in the seventeenth
century, and the Sultans at times inflicted punishments on the
Patriarchs, which recall the horrible mutilations of Byzantine times.
From the moment of the conquest, Christian churches, beginning with
St Sophia, were converted into mosques, and the seat of the Patriarchate,
fixed by Mohammed II at the Church of the Holy Apostles, was
successively moved, as church after church became a sacred place of
Islâm, till it reached, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, its
present home in the Phanar. All over Greece the same process went on,
wherever the Mussulmans were numerous, and we have seen at Salonika,
Livadia and Larissa buildings which have served first as churches and
then as mosques. Certain dues, too, were fixed, which the Patriarch was
expected to pay; and soon <i>bakshîsh</i>, the bane of Turkey, began to affect
Patriarchal elections. This introduction of simony into the Greek Church
was due to the intrigues of the Greeks themselves. After the fall of the
empire of Trebizond in 1461 many of the Trapezuntine grandees sought
careers at Constantinople. Among other posts they coveted that of the
Patriarch, and as early as 1467 they conspired with that object against
Markos II, the fourth successor of Gennadios<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>. They succeeded in
securing his deposition and the election of one of their own party by
promising that he would pay an annual sum of one thousand gold pieces
and forego the allowance which his four predecessors had received from
the government. The evil, thus soon introduced, spread apace. Two years
later, an offer of double the sum paid by the Patriarch ensured his
removal in favour of a wealthier candidate. Then the annual payment
was raised to three thousand gold pieces, and large sums came to be
spent in bribes to courtiers, eunuchs, janissaries and the female favourites
of the Sultans, the money being ultimately raised out of the clergy and
laity. Thus, the history of the Patriarchate resembles that of the
mediæval Papacy in that the same means were employed to ensure an
election. After the Reformation, Jesuits and Protestants, each anxious
to have at the head of the Greek Church a man favourable to themselves,
joined in the bidding, and between the years 1623 and 1700 there were
about fifty Patriarchal elections, most of them won by bribery. The debts
of the Patriarchate became enormous, as a consequence of this almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
constant expenditure, and the necessity thus imposed upon the Patriarch
of selling all the chief ecclesiastical offices in his gift was one of the main
causes which made the Greek Church so unpopular in many parts of
Turkey, where the population belonged to another race than the Hellenic.
The history of Roumania abounds with examples of the exactions of
Greek bishops, who sought to make the wretched people make up to
them what they had spent on the purchase of their sees.</p>

<p>Another cause tended, in course of time, to make the Turkish
Government less careful of the Patriarch’s privileges and dignities. He
had been regarded by Mohammed II as a bulwark against the Catholic
powers; but, a century after the fall of Constantinople, Rome, distracted
by the Protestant secession, had become far less dangerous, and Venice
had lost her last possessions in the Morea, while in the seventeenth
century Spain was no longer an enemy to be feared. Moreover, France,
the “eldest daughter of the Church,” and the patroness of the Jesuits,
had become the ally of Turkey, and supported her <i>protégés</i>, who first
appeared at Constantinople in 1609, against the Œcumenical Patriarch.
Thus, finding himself in little danger from a disunited Europe and an
impotent Papacy, the Sultan could afford to modify his attitude towards
the head of the Greek Church. After 1657, the Patriarch ceased to be
installed by the Sultan in person, who was thenceforth represented by
the Grand Vizier, and further restrictions were soon placed upon the
honours paid to him. Still, the Œcumenical Patriarch enjoyed, throughout
the Turkish domination, a great ecclesiastical and political position,
such as some of his predecessors had not held under the Byzantine
Empire, such as his successors have never held since the Church in Greece
became autocephalous, and the Bulgarian Church became independent.
In the Turkish days, he was the spiritual, and in many respects the
political, head, not only of the Greek subjects of the Sultan, but of all
the Orthodox Christians within his dominions, Bulgarians, Serbs<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>,
Albanians, and Armenians of the Orthodox rite, who, as well as Greeks,
were all collectively described as <i>Romaîoi</i>—for in those days religion
and not race was the mark by which Ottoman subjects were distinguished.
Moreover, he was not only the accredited representative of the Orthodox
with the Porte, but he was also the ecclesiastical superior of all the
Orthodox communities in the Venetian dominions, and he was therefore
permitted to correspond with all those foreign powers which had subjects
of that religion. Thus, so long as Venice was a Levantine State, she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
continual relations with the Patriarch, and the Venetian bailie at
Constantinople conducted diplomatic business with him, no less than
with the Turkish government. Mohammed II, in the treaty which he
concluded with Venice in the year after the capture of Constantinople,
specially provided for the preservation to the Patriarch of all the
revenues which his predecessors had received from the Orthodox. We
frequently find the Patriarchs intervening with the Venetians on behalf
of the Orthodox inhabitants of the Venetian colonies, sometimes urging
the claims of the Greeks of Koron, Modon and Crete, sometimes successfully
deprecating the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar in the
Venetian possessions, and in one case rebuking the Orthodox Cretans
for their persecution of the Jews. Nothing more clearly proves the
peculiar position of the Patriarch as the head of an <i>imperium in
imperio</i>, than the fact that the Turkish government conducted its
business with him through the medium of the <i>Reis-effendi</i>, or Minister
for foreign affairs. Not without reason did men address so powerful a
personage as “master” and even “king.” We might, indeed, compare
his situation with that of the Pope since 1870. Like the Pope, he had
no territory, but his ecclesiastical sway ranged over and beyond the
dominions of the sovereign, in whose capital his seat was fixed. Like
the Pope, he negotiated with diplomatists, corresponded with foreign
governments, and combined, or identified, politics and religion. And,
like the Pope, he at times intrigued against the monarch who had
ensured him the secure exercise of his privileges within his dominions.</p>

<p>Although the Koran forbade the forcible conversion of the Christians,
there were various causes which swelled the ranks of Islâm. The Turks,
being but a small body of men compared with the great numbers of the
Christians, early saw that they could neither preserve nor extend their
conquests without the aid of the latter. Accordingly, just as some
Christian rulers of the East had enlisted young Turks to fight their
battles, so the Sultan Orchan, more than a century before the capture
of Constantinople, founded the terrible institution of the Janissaries,
a corps entirely recruited from that time till the middle of the sixteenth
century from Christian children who embraced the faith of the sovereign.
At the outset the numbers of these children were not less than one
thousand a year, and they were taken at the tender age of six or seven
years at the most; but later on, perhaps in the reign of Mohammed II,
a regular levy of children was ordered to be made throughout all the
subject provinces of Turkey, with a few favoured exceptions. This
tribute of Christian children, or παιδομάζωμα, as the Greeks called it,
was subsequently erected into a complete system, and became one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
the greatest engines of conversion. Every five years, or even oftener,
for the tribute came at last to be levied annually, an officer of the
Janissaries would descend with a clerk upon each district, and demand
from the head man of the place a list of all the Christian families. Every
Christian father was compelled to make a declaration of the number of
his sons and to present them for inspection. At first, only one boy out
of every five and only one out of every family were taken. Then no
proportion was observed, but the government took as many children
as it wanted, always selecting the strongest, and not even sparing the
only son of a family. The age, too, was raised to ten, fifteen, and even
more years. We can easily imagine the misery inflicted upon the unhappy
parents by a system which recalled the fabled tribute paid by
the Athenians to the Minotaur. We are told by an eye-witness that
mothers sometimes prayed God to strike their sons dead in order to save
them from enlistment. Others, in order to evade the law, would marry
their children at nine years of age; but the authorities soon disregarded
these infantile unions, and marriage was no excuse in the eyes of an
arbitrary official. There were only two ways of avoiding the payment of
this hideous blood-tax—bribery or flight into one of the Venetian
colonies, and the latter means of escape became more difficult when
Venice lost her last possessions on the mainland. It might have been
thought that this tax would have been more likely to cause a rising. Yet
in the long list of insurrections against the Turks we can recall one only,
that of 1565, which is specially ascribed to this reason, and that was an
Albanian and not a Greek agitation<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>. Moreover, as time went on, and
the Janissaries became more pampered and more powerful, it was
esteemed by many a blessing rather than a curse that their sons should
serve in the corps. The Venetian bailie at Constantinople in the middle
of the sixteenth century expressly says that the tribute of children had
by that time come to be regarded as a special favour enjoyed by the
Christians, who were thus able to provide their sons with an easy and
comfortable profession! We even hear of Mussulman parents so anxious
to share in this singular privilege that they lent their children to the
Christians so that they might be enrolled as such among the Janissaries.
But the loss to Hellenism and to Christianity through the tribute of
children was enormous. If we remember that for two centuries the
Janissaries were exclusively recruited from the Christians, and that the
latter were chiefly to be found in European Turkey, and if we take into
consideration that the tribute children were not only the strongest
members of their respective families, but were also prohibited by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
original constitution of the corps from marrying, for the Janissaries,
like the Zulu army of Cetewayo, were a celibate body, we may form
some idea of what a drain the παιδομάζωμα was upon the actual and
possible resources of Eastern Christianity. A modern Greek historian<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
estimates at about a million the number of Christian children taken to
serve in the corps during the first two centuries of its existence. At last,
however, it fell into disuse, and in the seventeenth century ceased to
exist. A variety of causes contributed to the decline of an institution
which had so greatly strengthened the Turkish army at the expense of
the Christian population. From the time when the Janissaries were
allowed to marry, they naturally desired to have their own children taken
into the corps, while others obtained admission to its privileges by
bribery. On the other hand, the Sultans came to regard the Janissaries
as dangerous to themselves, much as the Roman Emperors had found
the Prætorians to be, and were thus less anxious to have the corps
recruited. The number of conversions to Islâm had also narrowed the
area of enlistment from among the Christians; and Rycaut, writing
shortly after the custom had fallen into disuse, mentions the corruption
of the officers and the carelessness in their discipline as the cause of its
decay. Accordingly we last hear of the tribute being levied in 1676,
though an isolated case is mentioned as late as 1703<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the tribute of Christian children, there was a further reason
for the conversion of the Greeks in the honours offered to those who
apostatised. When the Turks found themselves masters of a great
European Empire, they had neither the financial nor the diplomatic skill
requisite for conducting it. The Turkish method of keeping accounts was
cumbrous, the Turkish language is extremely difficult to write, and the
Turks resembled the British in their absolute ignorance of foreign tongues,
while treaties and diplomatic correspondence continued to be composed
in Greek. But empires are not won by linguists but by men of character,
who are easily able to find subtle intellects to do their office work for
them. The precise qualities which the Turks lacked the Greeks possessed,
and Mohammed II saw at once how useful the versatile talents of his
new subjects would be in the administration of his dominions. But there
was this difficulty, that nearly all the best educated Greeks had fled
abroad after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, and it was owing to this
reason that, during the two first centuries of the Turkish rule, the Greeks
did not, as a rule, rise higher in the Turkish service than a clerkship in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
the Treasury or the Foreign Office. There was, however, even at that
period, one notable exception, the office of Grand Vizier. Of the five
Grand Viziers of Mohammed II, two were Greeks, the former of whom,
Mahmûd Pasha, was the first Christian to hold that great position.
Under Bayezid II we find two more Greeks as Grand Viziers. Suleyman
the Magnificent gave that post to two others, and later on one Grand
Vizier was the son of a Greek priest; while the terrible Barbarossa, the
scourge of the Christians at sea, was of Greek origin. By the middle of
the sixteenth century the Venetian bailie at Constantinople could write
that the great places in the Sultan’s service usually fell to the Christians,
and the Turks complained that the children of the poor <i>rayah</i> were put
over their heads.</p>

<p>But for a long time these mundane advantages could only be
obtained by apostasy, and thus the lukewarm Christian had strong
incentives to turn Mussulman. But in Greece there were fewer conversions
than among the Slavs of Bosnia and the Herzegovina; and
when, about the middle of the seventeenth century, the Turkish
Government relaxed the strictness of its policy, and abolished religious
tests for certain important offices of state, the Greeks were able to
gratify a laudable ambition without abandoning the religion of their
fathers. By that time education had revived among the Greeks of the
capital, so that the lack of qualified Hellenes, which had been felt so
acutely immediately after the conquest, no longer existed. It was then
that, for the first time, a Greek was appointed Grand Dragoman of the
Porte in the person of Panagiotes Nikouses, who conducted the negotiations
for the surrender of Candia on behalf of the Turks. From the close
of that century down to the War of Independence most of his successors
in that post were Greeks<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>. Similarly, the position of Dragoman of the
Fleet was usually held by a Greek, and the island of Paros has still
many monuments of the family of Mavrogenes, two of whose members
conducted the naval negotiations of the Capitan Pasha. One of them,
Nicholas Mavrogenes, rose from that rank to be Prince of Wallachia;
and it is scarcely necessary to remind those who have studied Roumanian
history, that in the eighteenth and the first part of the nineteenth
century the two thrones of Moldavia and Wallachia were occupied by
Greeks, and the two Danubian principalities were regarded as the happy
hunting-ground of the Phanariotes of Constantinople. There was even
an idea of erecting the Morea into a Christian principality on similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
lines; and, though this was never carried out, the Morea was entrusted
to a native governor. But the advancement of the Greeks in the Turkish
service, though always beneficial to the individuals concerned and
sometimes to their employers, was of doubtful value to the Greek
national cause. When their private and racial interests clashed, the
Greek officials almost always sacrificed the latter, and, indeed, it would
have been an Utopian idea to expect the virtues of heroes and saints
from the descendants of men who for centuries had been under foreign
domination. It is easy for English historians, belonging to a race which
has never known what an alien yoke implies, to demand impossible
qualities from a down-trodden people, and we are fond of trying foreign
nations by an ideal standard—which fortunately we never apply to our
own public affairs. But, after all allowances have been made, it must
be confessed that some of the worst blows to Hellenism, such as the loss
of Eubœa and that of Crete, were dealt by the Greeks themselves, just
as the Bosnian, Cretan and Albanian apostates have ever been the
bitterest enemies of the Christians, and the warmest supporters of
Turkish rule, so long as it permitted them to tyrannise over their own
fellow-countrymen. In other words, religion replaced all racial
sympathies, and a Mussulman Slav or Cretan was first a Mussulman and
then a Slav or Cretan. Even in our own time, at the crisis of the Greco-Turkish
war of 1897, a Greek was trying to counteract Greek interests
in the capacity of Turkish ambassador in London; and the show statesmen
of the Porte, whose virtues and culture are always exhibited for
the edification of Europe, are invariably Greeks. Samos, too, with its
Greek prince, was, till 1912, an interesting survival of the former practice
of sending Greeks to rule beyond the Danube in the interest of the
Sultan.</p>

<p>On two occasions, under Selim II, in 1514, and in the early days of
the Candian war, in 1646, it was actually proposed to exterminate all
the Christians of Turkey. But wiser counsels happily prevailed; and
towards the close of the seventeenth century, as we saw, the policy of
the Turkish government was to preserve, rather than further diminish,
the numbers of its Christian taxpayers. By that time fears were felt
lest the Christians should continue to dwindle away, and a taxable
infidel seemed a more valuable asset than a less remunerative believer
in the true faith of Islâm. Accordingly, in 1691, a first serious attempt
was made to secure the Christians against exactions by the <i>Nizam-djedid</i><a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>,
or “new system,” which commanded the provincial governors
to levy no other impost than the <i>haratch</i>, or “capitation-tax,” from them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
Originally, the only fiscal disadvantages of the Christians, besides the
blood-tax of their children, had been this <i>haratch</i>, which was payable
by all unbelievers over the age of ten years, except priests, old men,
and the blind, the maimed, and the paralytic. A Christian had also to
pay on all imports and exports twice the duty levied upon a Mussulman.
But, as is still the case in Turkey, the hardships of taxation arose not
so much from its legal amount as from its illegal collection. Thus, in
1571, we hear of the incredible extortions suffered by the Christian
subjects of the Sultan, who were mostly so deeply sunk in poverty and
misery that they scarce durst look a Turk in the face, and who only
cultivated their lands sufficiently for their own wants and for the
payment of <i>haratch</i>, knowing that the Turks would seize any surplus
that was over<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>. However, the <i>Nizam-djedid</i> represented, like the
abolition of the tribute of children, a new and humaner policy, which
resulted in the diminution of apostasy. From that time onward the
Greeks had less temptation to become Mohammedans; the Venetian
occupation of the Morea in the early part of the eighteenth century had
the double effect of causing many re-conversions to Christianity, and of
forcing the Turks to treat their Greek subjects better, from fear of
comparisons; while, a little later, the Russian claims to a protectorate
over the Eastern Christians further checked the movement towards
Mohammedanism.</p>

<p>But it was not only in the numbers, but also in the quality of their
population, that the Greek provinces of Turkey suffered from the effects
of the Turkish conquest. Almost all the men of learning, nearly all the
chief families, in short the intellectual and political leaders of the people,
went into exile immediately after the fall of the Byzantine Empire.
Mohammed II did, indeed, address a proclamation in Greek to the
principal <i>archontes</i> of the Morea, in which he promised to respect their
families and property and make them more prosperous than before<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>;
but his promises had little effect in checking the general exodus of the
great Moreote families. So universal was their emigration, that only
four or five of the Peloponnesian clans, which had played the prominent
part during the mediæval period, remained behind, and there were
similar wholesale emigrations from continental Greece and Eubœa. As
the leading men all went with their relatives and followers, the drain
upon the Greek population was as serious a danger to the nation as the
emigration of the Peloponnesian peasants to America, which has lately
been robbing the land of its cultivators and causing widespread alarm
in the Greek press. Most of the exiles went, as was natural, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
Venetian possessions in Greece, which thus became what in earlier times
the Despotat of Mistra had been to the Franks—a thorn in the side of
the Turkish conqueror. Thus, Michael Ralles, one of the most prominent
of Spartan <i>archontes</i>, and the protagonist of the first Turco-Venetian war
after the conquest, and the brothers Daimonoyannai, belonging to the
great family of that name at Monemvasia, sought homes in the colonies
of the Republic in the Morea; thus, too, Graitzas Palaiologos, the last
defender of the peninsula, entered the Venetian service. Other Greek
leaders accompanied Sophia, daughter of Thomas Palaiologos, the last
Despot of the Morea, on her marriage with the Grand Duke Ivan of
Russia, and the Russian Court soon became another favourite resort of
the Peloponnesian magnates who had known her father, and whose
descendants were recruited three centuries later by a further band of
Greek refugees after the abortive rising in the Morea<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>. Many Greeks,
anxious to fight against the foes of their own, or even those of their
adopted country, became of their own free will Venetian light horsemen,
or <i>Stradioti</i>, just as others were forced to enlist in the ranks of the
Turkish Janissaries. The researches of a learned Greek historian have
thrown a flood of light upon the constitution and exploits of that
remarkable body of soldiers<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>. The name by which they were known is
not derived from the Greek word στρατιῶται (“soldiers”) but from the
Italian, <i>strada</i>, and signified that those who bore it were “always on
the road”—wanderers, who had no fixed abodes. Composed of Greeks
and Albanians, the corps was entirely recruited from the Morea, and
mainly from Laconia, but the most valiant were the men of Nauplia.
Among their leaders we find many historic Moreote names, such as those
of Boua and Palaiologos, whose bearers were descendants or relatives of
the men who had fought the good fight for the liberty of the Peloponnese.
The sixteenth century was the golden age of the <i>Stradioti</i>, who demonstrated
all over Europe that Greek valour was not extinct. One of them
was even in the service of our Henry VIII, fighting in Scotland and
acting as governor of Boulogne, at that time an English fortress. But
they had their weaknesses, as well as their good qualities, and their
inordinate vanity was the favourite theme of Venetian comedians, just
as Plautus had satirised the boastfulness of the <i>Miles Gloriosus</i> for the
amusement of the ancient Romans. Tasso has blamed their rapacity in
the line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Il leggier Greco alle rapine intento,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">but other poets have sung of their triumphs. Indeed, there were bards
in the ranks of the “wanderers” themselves, and a whole literature of
their poems has been published, mostly written in a peculiar dialect
resembling that now spoken in Calabria, where many Greek songs are
still sung by the descendants of the numerous Epeirote families settled
there after the Turkish conquest—the third time that Magna Græcia had
received a large Greek population. One of their number, Marullus, of
whom it was said that he “first united Apollo to Mars,” wrote Latin
alcaics and sapphics, which, if not exactly Horatian, are, at any rate,
as good as the ordinary product of the sixth-form intellect. Another,
Theodore Spandounis, or Spandugino, more usefully employed his pen
in the composition of a work on the Origin of the Ottoman Emperors,
with the patriotic object of arousing the sympathy of sixteenth-century
statesmen for the deliverance of Greece. The <i>Stradioti</i>, were, however,
mightier with the javelin and the mace—their characteristic weapons—than
with the pen. The long javelin, which they carried on horseback,
was a particularly formidable weapon. Shod at both ends with a sharp
iron point, it could be used either way with equally deadly effect; and
if it failed, the agile horseman could seize the mace which hung at his
saddle bow, and bring it down on the skull of an opponent. Unfortunately,
the blow was rarely struck for Greece, and the skull was usually that of a
Christian, against whom the <i>Stradioti</i> had no personal or national quarrel.</p>

<p>But Greece was deprived of her literary as well as her military men
by the Turkish conquest. For almost the first time in her long history,
all traces of learning vanished from the home of the Muses. Most of the
scholarly Greeks of that age emigrated to Italy, and, just as, in the
words of Horace, “Captive Greece led her victors captive,” after her
subjugation by the unlettered Romans, so, sixteen centuries later, she
once more spread the light of Hellenic studies in the darkest West.
Thus, the Athenian, Demetrios Chalkokondyles, became the tutor of
one of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s sons at Florence, while the Spartan, George
Hermonymos, was the first Greek who publicly taught that language in
Paris. Two other Moreotes, Demetrios Ralles, a soldier and scholar, and
Isidore, who had distinguished himself alike in theology and in the
defence of Constantinople, spent the rest of their lives in Italy, while the
historian Phrantzes wrote his history and died in peace at Corfù under
the Venetian protection. We owe much of our modern culture to this
fifteenth-century dispersion of the learned Greeks; but the gain of
Europe was the loss of Greece. It required the lapse of two whole
centuries to make up in the least degree the deficiencies in Greek
education, which the departure of all these men of light and leading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
caused; and if they strove to interest European courts and scholars in
the fortunes of their abandoned country, that was of small practical
advantage compared with the loss which they inflicted upon it. Had they
remained in Greece, their influence would soon have made itself felt;
they would have obtained posts in the Turkish service, which might
have enabled them to improve the condition of their fellow-countrymen,
and their example would have prevented the complete spread of
ignorance over large parts of Greece during the first two centuries after
the conquest.</p>

<p>The flight of these two classes—the <i>archontes</i> and the men of letters—made
the provincial landowners, the peasants, and the parish priests,
who mostly sprang from the ranks of the latter, the sole representatives
of the Greek nation<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. But, though Hellenism has never suffered such
enormous losses as during the Turkish period, owing to conversions to
Islâm and emigration to the West, there never was any time in the history
of Greece under alien dominion when the Greek race remained so pure
as between the Turkish conquest and the War of Independence. There
can be no doubt that, after the long era of confusion and disorder which
had followed the break-up of the Frankish power in Greece, even the
Turkish, or any other strong Government—and at that time Turkey
was strong and the Sultans could govern—must have proved a benefit
to the great mass of the population. Moreover, from the date of the
Turkish conquest the immigrations of the foreign elements, which had
occurred so often during the Byzantine and Frankish period, ceased,
and for nearly four centuries the Hellenic race was uncontaminated by
alien blood. The Franks left behind them few survivors, except in the
islands, and there were no Slavonic raids, while the Greeks, who remained
true to their faith, never intermarried with the Turks, for a Greek woman
who became the wife of a Mussulman was excommunicated. The two
religions remained absolutely apart, and, under Turkish rule, for the
first time for centuries, perhaps also for the last, there was no racial
rivalry between the Christians of the Near East. Union reigned between
Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, Albanians and Roumanians; and the doctrine
of nationalities, nowadays the keynote of Balkan politics, had no
influence under the Turkish system of that period, which treated all
Christians of whatever race as the inferiors of all Mussulmans, whether
of Turkish, Slavonic, Albanian or Greek extraction.</p>

<p>Education was scanty enough in the Venetian possessions, as we
saw in the case of Corfù; but it was much worse in Turkish Greece. For
two hundred years after the conquest there was practically nothing done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
for the instruction of those Greeks who remained under the Turks, and
even archbishops could with difficulty write their own names correctly.
Larissa in Thessaly was then one of the wealthiest of Greek sees; yet
a Greek scholar, who examined the archiepiscopal records during the
Turkish period, found them a mass of bad grammar and remarkable
spelling. As for literature, though Sathas has compiled a work on the
Greek authors of the long period between the capture of Constantinople
and the War of Independence, only four of them, with the exception of
a few theological writers, came from Greece proper. Two of these four
were the brothers Laonikos and Demetrios Chalkokondyles, of Athens,
the former of whom wrote his history of the Turks in Italy, while the
latter composed his critical editions of Homer, Isokrates and Suidas
at Milan, where his monument may be seen in the church of Sta Maria
della Passione. The remaining two were born and bred in Nauplia, at
that time Venetian. One, Zygomalas, composed a <i>Political History of
Constantinople from 1391 to 1578</i>; the other, Malaxos, produced a
vernacular version of the <i>Patriarchal History</i> of the same city, where
both resided for a great part of their lives. Another historical work, the
<i>Chronicle</i> of Dorotheos, Metropolitan of Monemvasia, was written in
Moldavia. It originally contained the history of the world from the
creation down to the year 1629, but was subsequently extended to 1685,
and for two hundred years after its publication was “the only historical
text-book used by the Greek people.” At last, towards the middle of the
seventeenth century, an educational revival began in Greece, which
derived its origin from the <i>Flangineion</i>, or Greek school founded by the
Corfiote, Flangines, at Venice, in 1626, and still existing. The Hellenic
community in that city, largely composed of business men, interested—as
the Greek merchants of London, Manchester and Alexandria still
are in the intellectual, moral and material welfare of their fatherland,
sent out educational missionaries, who spread the gospel of learning in
the home of their race. One of these Greeks of Venice, a native of
Joannina, founded in 1647, two schools, one in his native town<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>, another
at Athens, where the Catholic monks also taught the young Athenians
about the same period.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the Greeks acquiesced patiently in
the Turkish domination for more than three centuries. The long rule
of the Franks had had the effect of making the natives far more warlike
than they had been before the Latin conquest; but the conviction of
the overwhelming power of the Turks rendered them reluctant to rise,
except when they were sure of foreign aid. During the first few years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
which followed the capture of Constantinople it seemed, indeed, as if
such assistance would be speedily forthcoming. The East expected, and
the West meditated, a new crusade against the Infidel. A Greek poet
appealed to “French and English, Spaniards and Germans,” to make
common cause for the recovery of Constantinople<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>. The many learned
Greeks who had been scattered all over western Europe by the loss of
that city endeavoured to interest the rulers of Christendom in the fate
of their fellow-countrymen. Prominent among these missionaries of
Hellenism was the famous Cardinal Bessarion of Trebizond, who was
twice regarded as a likely candidate for the Papacy, and who travelled
across Europe with untiring zeal on behalf of the conquered Greeks.
The Popes of that period—men, for the most part, of learning and
statesmanlike views—warmly supported the plan, and Pius II set out
to Ancona, where the crusaders were to assemble. But his death at that
seaport caused the collapse of the proposed expedition, and the crusade,
for which such great preparations had been made, ended in a fiasco.</p>

<p>For 80 years after the Turkish conquest Venice continued to keep
a foothold in the Morea, and consequently Greece became from time to
time the scene of Turco-Venetian wars, for the Sultans naturally desired
to round off their Greek territories by the acquisition of the remaining
Venetian colonies upon Greek soil. The first of these wars, lasting, more
or less continuously, from 1463 to 1479, led to the temporary capture of
the lower town of Athens by Vettor Capello in 1466—the second
occasion on which that famous city had fallen into Venetian hands. It is
characteristic of Turkish toleration, that at that time the heretics, known
as the <i>fraticelli della mala opinione</i>, whom in that very year Pope Paul II
was persecuting and imprisoning in the castle of Sant’ Angelo<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> and whose
church may still be seen on Monte Sant’ Angelo between Poli and Casape
in the Roman Campagna, were living quietly at Athens. For more than
a century Athens disappeared from the notice of the western world, but
a Greek chronicle in the library of Lincoln College, Oxford, informs us
that seven severe plagues afflicted the city between 1480 and 1554, and
that the aqueduct was begun in 1506. We know, too, of the existence of
three Metropolitans of Athens during the first century of Turkish rule,
and somewhat later an Athenian became Œcumenical Patriarch. But
the honour of having momentarily re-occupied Athens was far outweighed
in the minds of the practical Venetians by the definite loss of
Argos and Negroponte during this war, while the Greeks had been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
chief sufferers whichever side was victorious. The next Turco-Venetian
war, which began in 1499 and was closed by the treaty of 1502-3, yet
further diminished the colonies of Venice, involving the loss of Lepanto,
her last outpost on the mainland north of the Isthmus, and of Modon,
Koron and Navarino, in the Morea, where Nauplia and Monemvasia,
with the castles depending upon them, alone remained. The thirty
years’ peace which followed enabled Greece to recover somewhat from
the ravages of the late struggle, while patriotic Greek exiles, like Markos
Mousouros and Joannes Laskaris in vain tried to interest the powers in
a fresh crusade for their deliverance. Charles V was not the man to
liberate Greece for the sake of those ancient heroes and sages, whose
names Laskaris invoked in an eloquent speech, and when, in 1532, war
broke out between him and the Sultan, he showed more anxiety to
damage the Turks than to benefit the Greeks, who paid dearly for the
triumphs of the Genoese admiral, Andrea Doria. The re-capture of Koron
(like that of Modon by the Knights of St John in the previous year)
merely led to its abandonment and the compulsory emigration of its
unwilling inhabitants to Sicily and Naples. Then, in 1537, came the
Turco-Venetian war, which was destined to cost the Republic Ægina,
Mykonos, the Northern Sporades and her last surviving colonies in the
Morea. For nearly 150 years after the disastrous peace of 1540 Venice
did not own an inch of soil on the mainland of Greece, except the Ionian
dependencies of Parga and Butrinto, but of her insular dominions
Cyprus, Crete, Tenos and six Ionian islands still remained.</p>

<p>For the next thirty years after the disappearance of the Venetian
flag from the Morea, the Greeks were undisturbed by further fighting
on the mainland, though learned men continued to make appeals to
Europe on their behalf. The fall of the Duchy of Naxos in 1566 and the
capture of Chios from the <i>maona</i>, or Chartered Company, of the
Giustiniani of Genoa, in the same year yet further diminished the
influence of the Latins in the Levant; but it was not till Selim II
attacked the (since 1489) Venetian island of Cyprus in 1570, that Greece
once more became the theatre of a European war. The first operations
of the Venetians were directed against the coast opposite Corfù and
against a fort which the Turks had newly constructed to command the
Mainate harbour of Porto delle Quaglie, where the Turkish galleys could
wait and intercept the Venetian vessels on their way to Cyprus. Thanks
to the aid of the Mainates, ever ready for a fight, the Venetian commander
was able to capture this strong position. But he found it necessary to
blow it up, as he could not retain it, and sailed for the island of Andros,
captured by the Turks four years before, whose Greek inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
suffered more than the garrison from the excesses of his soldiers<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>.
Meanwhile, the Republic had been working hard to form an alliance
against the Sultan. At last, in the spring of 1571, a league was concluded
at Rome between Pope Pius V, Philip II of Spain, and the
Venetians for the destruction of the Ottoman power. It was the
thirteenth time that a Holy Alliance had been made with that object;
but it seemed as if the efforts of Christendom would finally be crowned
with success. A large fleet was collected, under the supreme command
of Don John of Austria, bastard son of the Emperor Charles V, while
the papal galleys were placed under the charge of Marcantonio Colonna.
But more than a month before the Armada had left Sicily for Corfù
Cyprus had fallen, and while the allies were discussing their plans the
Turkish fleet had ravished the Cretan coast, and carried off more than
6000 souls from Cephalonia. It was not till the morning of October 7
that the two navies met. The Turkish commander had taken up his
position off Lepanto; while the Christian ships were stationed off the
Echinades islands, outside the Gulf of Corinth. Against the advice of
wiser men, Ali, the Turkish admiral, issued from the Gulf in search of
the enemy. Suddenly the two fleets came in sight of one another. It
was a striking scene; the varied colours of the Ottoman ships lighted up
by the brilliant sunshine, which played upon the shining cuirasses of the
Christian warriors; the blue waves of a Greek sea, calm and peaceful,
where, centuries before, Corinthians and Corcyræans had fought a naval
battle. On either side their modern representatives were to be found,
25,000 were serving as sailors in the Ottoman service, and 5000 more
were on board the Venetian ships. Several Venetian galleys were
actually commanded by Greeks; especially noteworthy were the exploits
of the Corfiote Condocalli, who was the most famous of these Greek
commanders; among his Greek colleagues were two Cretans, one a
member of the historic clan of the Kallergai, whose name is writ large
in the stormy history of the great Greek island. The contemporary
Venetian historian, Paruta<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>, specially awards the palm for courage,
discipline, and skill combined to the Greeks, “as being most accustomed
to that kind of warfare,” while he places both Italians and Spaniards
below them. And another historian, Sagredo, says that “being more
experienced in seafaring, they contributed not a little to the victory<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>.”
The defeat of the Turks was overwhelming; 224 ships taken or destroyed
and 30,000 men slain represented their losses, while the allies lost only
15 galleys and 8000 men. Among the dead were the Turkish admiral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
and many of the scions of the noblest Venetian houses; among the
wounded was the author of <i>Don Quixote</i>, who lost, like Æschylos at
Marathon, a hand at Lepanto for the cause of Greece. The first impression
which the victory caused at Constantinople was one of consternation,
and for three days Selim refused to take food. Nor was this dismay
without foundation: the Ottoman fleet had been annihilated; the Greeks
were in revolt; and a cool-headed French diplomatist considered that
the allies could easily have destroyed the Turkish Empire and taken
Constantinople. But the discord of the victors and the energy of the
Grand Vizier, Mohammed Sokolli, saved the Ottoman dominions. Within
eight months after the battle a new Turkish fleet of 250 galleys, fifteen
of which were contributed by the wealthy Greek merchant of Constantinople,
Michael Cantacuzene, better known from his nickname of
Saïtan Oglou, or “the Devil’s son,” left the Dardanelles, and Sokolli,
contrasting the capture of Cyprus with the barren victory of Lepanto,
could truly say that, if “the Republic had shorn his beard, he had cut
off one of her arms.”</p>

<p>The battle of Lepanto has made a great noise in history, and Rome
and Venice still preserve many memorials of that victory. But its results
were valueless, so far as the Greeks were concerned, and, indeed, it
would have been better for them if it had never been fought. They
had welcomed with enthusiasm the advent of the allied fleet, which
they confidently hoped would free them from the Turkish yoke; and,
in the first excitement of the Christian victory, they flew to arms, and
begged the victors to support their efforts on land by the presence
of the fleet off the coast of the Morea. But, as usual, the Christian
commanders differed as to the best means of utilising their success. At
the council of war, which was held on board after the battle, one party
advocated a naval demonstration off the Peloponnese, and another
the capture of Eubœa, while a third proposed the seizure of Santa Maura,
which the Venetians alone actually attempted, and a fourth suggested
the siege of the two forts on either side of the Corinthian Gulf. In the
end, as the season was far advanced, all farther united action was
postponed to next year, and the fleet withdrew to Corfù, whence the
Spanish and Papal contingents sailed to Italy, leaving the insurgents
to themselves<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>. Many Moreotes had crossed over to the little town of
Galaxidi, which the visitor to Delphi sees as he approaches the harbour
of Itea, and there in a church they solemnly bound themselves, together
with the townsfolk and the inhabitants of Salona, to rise against the
Turk on the self-same day. “May he, who repents him of his oath or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
betrays what we have said, never see the face of God,” so runs the
picturesque formula of the conspirators in the <i>Chronicle of Galaxidi</i><a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.
“And then,” says the Chronicler, “they all lifted up their hands to the
eikons and swore a terrible oath.” But there was at least one traitor
in the church at Galaxidi, a man from Aigion, on the opposite shore of
the Gulf, who betrayed the dread secret to the Turks. While in the
Morea the Ottomans wreaked vengeance on the conspirators and burnt
the Archbishop of Patras alive as a fearful example, the ringleaders of
the insurrection at Galaxidi, still “relying on the aid of the Franks,”
marched with 3000 men against the noble Catalan fortress of Salona,
then the residence of a Turkish Bey. On their arrival, however, they
found a Turkish force drawn up in order of battle, and no Frankish
contingent awaiting them. Disheartened and abandoned, they trusted
to the invitation of the crafty Bey, who bade them come and tell him
the story of their woes. The Bey received the deputation, eighty in all,
with every honour, and listened sympathetically to their tale, bidding
them be good subjects and mind their own affairs for the future. But,
when the evening was come, he threw them into a dungeon of the
castle, where all save one, a priest who escaped by his great personal
strength, “died for their country and their faith.” Meanwhile, the
Moreotes who had escaped from the Turks, had taken refuge in Maina,
where the two brothers Melissenoi, from Epidauros, members of that
famous Peloponnesian family, placed themselves at the head of 28,000
men, who continued the struggle for two whole years in that difficult
country. Don John, who was still lingering idly at Messina, afraid to
return to the East in consequence of the growing dissensions between
France and Spain, wrote to one of the heroic brothers, bidding him keep
the insurrection going till his arrival<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>. But it was not till August, 1572,
that the victor of Lepanto again joined the allies in Greek waters. Even
then, he accomplished nothing. For some time the two hostile fleets
hovered off the coast of Messenia without an engagement, and attempts
upon Navarino and Modon were abandoned. Then, as in the previous
year, the allied armada broke up, while the Moreote insurgents withdrew
to the most inaccessible mountains, until, abandoning all hope of their
emancipation, they once more bowed their necks beneath the Turkish
yoke<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>. The two Melissenoi survived and escaped to Naples, where a
monument, removed in 1634, was erected to them in the Greek Church
of SS. Peter and Paul<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>, with an appropriate inscription, like those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
commemorating two exiles from Koron. Early in 1573 Venice made
peace with the Sultan, and the historian Paruta considered that such a
course was the wisest that his country could have adopted. The Republic
acquiesced in the loss of Cyprus, and gained nothing in return for her
efforts and her losses of blood and treasure during the war but the barren
laurels of Lepanto. Upon the Turks the lessons of the recent campaign
had not been thrown away. In order to check any fresh Greek rising,
they fortified the coasts of the Morea, and built a fort at the entrance of
the famous haven of Navarino. Nor had the disillusioned Greeks failed
to gain a sad experience from their abandonment. Now, for the first
time, we find the Venetian representative in Constantinople writing that
the Sultan was afraid of the Muscovite, because of the devotion shown
by the Eastern Christians towards a ruler of their own faith. As early
as 1576 that astute diplomatist remarked that the Greeks were ready
to take up arms and place themselves under Russian protection, in
order to escape from the Turkish yoke<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>. The shadow of the Russian
bear was beginning to wax, while that of the Venetian lion waned.</p>

<p>One result of the battle of Lepanto was to turn the attention of
civilised Europe to Greece. Four years after the victory we find Athens
“re-discovered” by the curiosity of Martin Kraus—or Crusius, as he
styled himself—a professor at Tübingen, who wrote for information
about the celebrated city to Theodosios Zygomalas, a Greek born at
Nauplia but living at Constantinople. Zygomalas had often visited
Athens, which the frequent wars in the Levant, the depredations of
corsairs, and the fact that the usual pilgrims’ route to Palestine lay far
to the south had so completely isolated from Europe that the densest
ignorance prevailed about it in the West. He mentions in his reply the
melody of the Athenian songs, which “charmed those who heard them,
as though they were the music of sirens,” the salubrity of the air, the
excellence of the water, the good memories and euphonious voices of the
inhabitants, among whom, as he states elsewhere, there then were
“about 160 bishops and priests.” At the same time he remarks of the
language then spoken at Athens that “if you heard the Athenians talk
your eyes would fill with tears.” Another Greek, Simeon Kabasilas of
Arta, informed Kraus that of all the seventy odd dialects of Greece the
Attic of that day was the worst. The Greek and “Ishmaelite,” or
Turkish, populations lived, he wrote, in separate quarters of the town,
which contained “12,000 male inhabitants<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>.” We learn too, from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
short account of Athens discovered in the National Library at Paris in
1862, and composed in Greek in the sixteenth century<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>, that the Tower
of the Winds was then a <i>tekkeh</i> of dervishes, and the mosque in the
Parthenon was called Ismaïdi.</p>

<p>In spite of the depreciatory remarks on the culture of the sixteenth-century
Athenians which Kraus permitted himself to make on the
strength of his second-hand investigations, learning was even in that
age not quite extinct in its ancient home. It was then that there flourished
at Athens an accomplished nun, Philothee Benizelou, afterwards included,
for her piety and charitable foundations, among those whom the
Greek Church calls “blessed,” and buried in the beautiful little
Gorgoepekoos church. But, though she founded the Convent of St
Andrew on the site of what is now the chapel of the Metropolitan of
Athens, within whose walls she established the first girls’ school of
Turkish Athens, she has left a most uncomplimentary description of the
Athenians of her day, with whom she had some pecuniary difficulties
and upon whom she showers a string of abusive epithets in the best
classical style<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>. Two other religious foundations also mark this period—that
of the Church of the Archangels in 1577 in the Stoa of Hadrian,
where an inscription still commemorates it, and that of the monastery
of Pentele, built in the following year by Timotheos, Archbishop of
Eubœa, whose skull, set in jewels, may still be seen there. The monks of
Pentele had to send 3000 <i>okes</i> of honey every year to the great mosques
of Constantinople<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>. We may infer from these facts that the Turkish
authority sat lightly upon a town which was allowed the rare privilege
of erecting new places of worship. The idea too then current in the West
that Athens had been entirely destroyed, and that its site was occupied
by a few huts, was obviously as absurd as the sketches of the city in
the form of a Flemish or German town which were made in the fifteenth
century. A place of “12,000 men” was not to be despised; and, if we
may accept the statement of Kabasilas<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>, the male population of the
Athens of 1578 was twice as large as the whole population of the Athens
which Otho made his capital in 1834, and about equal to the entire
population estimated by Stuart, Holland, Forbin and Pouqueville in
the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It has sometimes been
supposed, in accordance with the local tradition, that the city was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
placed, immediately after the Turkish conquest, under the authority of
the chief eunuch at Constantinople; but it has now been shown that that
arrangement was introduced much later. From the Turkish conquest
to the capture of Eubœa from the Venetians in 1470 Athens was the
seat of a pasha, and capital of the first of the five <i>sandjaks</i>, or provinces,
into which the conqueror divided continental Greece. In that year the
seat of the pasha was transferred to Chalkis, which then became the
capital of the <i>sandjak</i> of the Euripos, of which Athens sank to be a
district, or <i>caza</i>. In this position of dependence the once famous city
continued till about the year 1610, being administered by a subordinate
of the Eubœan pasha<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>, who every year paid it a much-dreaded visit of
inspection, which, like most Turkish official visits, was very expensive
to the hosts.</p>

<p>From the conclusion of the war of Cyprus in 1573 to the outbreak
of the Cretan war in 1645 there was peace between Venice and the Turks,
so that Greece ceased for over seventy years to be the battle-ground of
those ancient foes. But spasmodic risings still occurred even during that
comparatively quiet period. Thus, in 1585, a famous <i>armatolós</i>, Theodore
Boua Grivas, raised the standard of revolt in the mountainous districts
of Akarnania and Epeiros, at the instigation of the Venetians. His
example was followed by two other <i>armatoloí</i>, Drakos and Malamos,
who took Arta and marched on Joannina. But this insurrection was
speedily suppressed by the superior forces of the Turks, and Grivas,
badly wounded, was fain to escape to the Venetian island of Ithake,
where he died of his injuries<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>. Somewhat later, in 1611, Dionysios,
Archbishop of Trikkala, made a further attempt on Joannina; but he was
betrayed by the Jews, then, as ever, on the Turkish side, and flayed alive.
His skin, stuffed with straw, was sent to Constantinople. Another
Thessalian archbishop, accused of complicity with him, was offered the
choice of apostasy or death, and manfully chose the latter, a choice
which has given him a place in the martyrology of modern Greece<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>.</p>

<p>The greatest disturbance to the pacific development of the country
arose, however, from the corsairs, who descended upon its coasts almost
without intermission from the date of the Turkish conquest to the latter
part of the seventeenth century. The damage inflicted by these pirates,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
who belonged to the Christian no less than to the Mussulman religion,
and who made no distinction between the creeds of their victims, led
the Greeks to dwell at a distance from the seaboard, in places that were
not easily accessible; and thus the coast acquired that deserted look
which it has not wholly lost even now<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. The worst of these wretches
were the Uscocs of Dalmatia, whose inhuman cruelties have rarely been
surpassed. Sometimes they would eat the hearts of their victims;
sometimes they would chain the crew below the deck, and then leave
the captured vessel adrift, and its inmates to die of starvation, on the
blue Ionian or the stormy Adriatic sea. In addition to the common
pirates there were organised freebooters of higher rank, such as the
Knights of Santo Stefano, founded by Cosimo I de’ Medici in 1560, and
the Knights of Malta. The former, whose church at Pisa contains on its
ceiling a picture of the taking and plunder of “Nicopolis Actiaca” (the
modern Prevesa) in 1605, besides many Turkish trophies, were convenient
auxiliaries of the Florentine fleet, because their exploits could be disowned
by the government if unsuccessful. Towards the close of the
sixteenth century the Florentines were able to occupy Chios for a
moment; but the Turks soon regained possession of that rich island, and
visited the sins of the Tuscans upon the inhabitants whom they had
come to deliver. Years afterwards a traveller saw a row of grim skulls
on the battlements of the fort, and the descendants of the Genoese
settlers, who had hitherto received specially favourable treatment from
the Sultan, were so badly treated that they mostly emigrated<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>. In
emulation of the Knights of Santo Stefano those of Malta in 1603
sacked Patras, which had been burned by a Spanish squadron only
eight years before, and occupied Lepanto, which in the seventeenth
century bore the ominous nickname of “Little Algiers,” from the pirates
of Algiers and Tripoli who made it their headquarters. When, in 1676,
the traveller Spon visited it, he found a number of Moors settled down
there with their coal-black progeny<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>. A few years later the Maltese,
baffled in an attempt on Navarino, retaliated on Corinth, whence they
carried off 500 captives. Finally in 1620 they assailed the famous
Frankish castle of Glarentza, in the strong walls of which their bombs
opened a breach; but the approach of a considerable Turkish force
compelled them to return to their ships, after having attained no other
result than that of having injured one of the most interesting mediæval
monuments in Greece. Another Frankish stronghold, that of Passavâ,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
was surprised by the Spaniards when they ravaged Maina in 1601. The
co-operation of that restive population with the invaders, whose
predatory tastes they shared, led the Porte to adopt strong measures
against the Mainates, who in 1614 were, in name at least, reduced to
submission and compelled to pay tribute<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>. But though the capitan
pasha was thus able to starve Maina into submission he could not protect
the Greeks against the pirates, who so long preyed upon their commerce,
burnt their villages, debauched their women, and desolated their land.
Had Turkey been a strong maritime power, able to sweep piracy from
the seas, Greece would have been spared much suffering and would have
had less damage to repair.</p>

<p>It was at this time too that the classic land of the arts began to
suffer from another form of depredation, that of the cultured collector.
To a British nobleman belongs the discredit of this revival of the work
of Nero. About 1613 the earl of Arundel was seized with the idea of
“transplanting old Greece into England.” With this object he commissioned
political agents, merchants, and others, chief among them
William Petty, uncle of the well-known political economist, to scour the
Levant in quest of statues. His example speedily found imitators, such
as the duke of Buckingham, and King Charles I, who charged the
English admiral in the Levant, Sir Kenelm Digby, with the duty of
collecting works of art for the royal palace. Needless to say the rude
sailors who were ordered to remove the precious pieces of marble often
mutilated what they could not remove intact. They sawed in two a
statue of Apollo at Delos, and they might have anticipated the achievements
of Lord Elgin at Athens had not its distance from the sea and the
suspicions of the Turkish garrison on the Akropolis saved it from the
fate to which the Cyclades were exposed<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.</p>

<p>While the corsairs were devastating Greece a picturesque adventurer,
who recalls the abortive scheme of Charles VIII of France, was engaged
in planning her deliverance. Charles Gonzaga, duc de Nevers, boasted
of his connection with the imperial house of the Palaiologoi through his
grandmother, Margaret of Montferrat, a descendant of the Emperor
Andronikos Palaiologos the Elder<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>. After having fought against the
Turks in Hungary he conceived the romantic idea of claiming the throne
of Constantinople, with which object he visited various European courts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
and about 1612 entered into negotiations with the Greeks. His schemes
received a willing hearing from the restless Mainates, who sent three
high ecclesiastics to assure him of their readiness to recognise him as their
liege lord if he would send them a body of experienced officers to organise
a force of 10,000 Greeks. They even promised to become Roman Catholics,
and arranged, on paper, for the division of the Turkish lands among
themselves, and for the confiscation of all Jewish property in order to
defray the expenses of the expedition. The pretender, on his part, sent
three trusty agents to spy out the land and make plans of the Turkish
positions; they came back with most hopeful accounts of the enthusiasm
of the Mainates, who were only waiting for the favourable moment to
raise the two-headed eagle on the walls of Mistra. Neophytos, the bishop
of Maina, and Chrysanthos Laskaris, the Metropolitan of Lacedæmon,
and namesake of the Manuel Laskaris whose tomb may still be seen in
one of the churches at Mistra, addressed him as Constantine Palaiologos,
and told him to hasten his coming among his faithful people, who in
proof of their submission sent him some falcons.</p>

<p>But the duc de Nevers wasted in diplomacy time which should have
been devoted to prompt action. He appealed to Pope Paul V, the Grand
Duke of Tuscany, the King of Spain, and the Emperor, who were all
profuse in promises and some of whom furnished him with ships and
money. An attempt was also made to stir up the other Christian
nationalities of the East, and a meeting of Albanian, Bosnian, Macedonian,
Bulgarian and Serbian leaders was held for the purpose of
concerted action, while the two <i>hospodars</i> of Moldavia and Wallachia
promised their aid. Another adventurer, who styled himself Sultan
Zachias and gave out that he was a brother of the Sultan Ahmed I, was
admitted as an ally. Finally, in order to give a religious character to
the movement, the duke founded and became chief of a body calling
itself the “Christian army,” commissions in which were offered to the
conspirators, among whom we find the name of a learned Athenian,
Leonardos Philaras<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>, who was patronised by Richelieu and to whom
Milton addressed two letters. A date was fixed for the rising, and four
memoranda were addressed to the duke, with full particulars of his
future realm of Greece. From these we learn that in 1619 the Peloponnese
could furnish him with 15,000 fighting men, while it contained
8000 Turks capable of bearing arms, of whom 800 formed the scanty
garrisons of Koron, Modon, Navarino and Nauplia. At that time, we are
told, there were 800 Turkish military fiefs in the Morea, and the population
of Maina was estimated at 4913 families, spread over 125 villages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
and hamlets. These statistics are the most valuable result of the
agitation.</p>

<p>After several years of correspondence and negotiation the pretender
at last managed to equip five vessels for the transport of his crusaders;
but a sudden fire, perhaps the work of an incendiary, laid them in ashes,
and the jealousy of Spain and Venice prevented any effective political
action. The “Christian army” still went on meeting and discussing its
plan of campaign, and two more strange adventurers—a Moor who had
become a Christian and styled himself “Infant of Fez,” and a Greek
who, with even greater ambition, had adopted the title of “prince of
Macedonia”—became the principal agents of the duke. At last, however,
every one grew weary of his absurd pretensions, and the secession of
the Pope from his side finally destroyed his hopes<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>.</p>

<p>During the Cretan war between Venice and the Turks two risings
were promoted by the Venetians in Greece for the purpose of diverting
the attention of their enemies. In 1647 the Venetian admiral, Grimani,
after chasing the Turkish fleet to Eubœa and Volo, blockaded it within
the harbour of Nauplia. At this the Albanians of the Peloponnese, who
were very favourable to the Republic, rose against the Turks, and after
having done a considerable amount of damage to Turkish property,
escaped punishment by fleeing on board the Venetian squadron. A
Greek, more daring but less fortunate, conceived the idea of setting fire
to the Turkish vessels as they lay in harbour, but paid for his audacity
with his life<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>. In 1659 the Mainates, who had availed themselves of the
war to throw off every shadow of subjection to the Sultan, but who
plundered Venetian and Turkish ships with equal impartiality, were
induced by the great Francesco Morosini to devote their abilities to the
plunder of the Morea. At that time piracy was the principal profession
of the Mainate population, who sold Christians to Turks and Turks to
Christians. Priests and monks, we are told, joined in the business, and
the fact that they lived in caves overlooking the sea made them valuable
auxiliaries of the pirates, whom they informed of the approach of passing
vessels. Some of them even embarked on board the pirate schooners,
for the purpose of levying the tithe which was allotted by the pious
freebooters to the Church<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>. These schooners sometimes sailed out among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
the Cyclades, and just as Lepanto was nicknamed “Little Algiers” so
Vitylos in Maina was called “Great Algiers.” Well acquainted with the
influence of the Church in eastern politics, Morosini worked upon the
feelings of the Mainates by taking with him the deposed Œcumenical
Patriarch, then living on the island of Siphnos. The pirates of Maina
humbly kissed the hand of the eminent ecclesiastic, and 10,000 of them,
with 3000 Greeks and Albanians, assisted the Venetian commander in
an attack upon Kalamata, which was abandoned by its Mussulman and
Christian inhabitants alike to its rapacious assailants. The Cretan poet
Bouniales has left a graphic account of their proceedings in his poem on
the Cretan war.</p>

<p>But no strategic result accrued from the sack of Kalamata; Morosini
sailed off to the Ægean, advising the Mainates to reserve their energies
for a more favourable opportunity of conquering the Peloponnese. The
auxiliaries of the Venetian commander, pending that event, continued
to prey upon Turkish vessels, and even attacked the fleet of the Grand
Vizier, Ahmed Köprili, which was then engaged in the siege of Candia.
The offer of double the pay of his own soldiers could not bribe the
Mainates to desist from their at once patriotic and profitable piracies.
Baffled by their refusal, the Grand Vizier ordered Hasân-Babâ, a pirate
of renown and accounted the best seaman in the Turkish fleet, to reduce
Maina to submission. But the women of Maina sufficed to strike terror
into the heart of the bold Hasân. “Tell my husband,” said one of them,
“to mind the goat, and hold the child, and I will go and find his weapons
and use them better than he.” At the head of the population the women
marched down to the shore, and the Turkish captain thought it wiser
to remain on board. But in the evening experienced swimmers cut the
cables of his ships, two of which were driven upon the rocks of that iron
coast and became the prey of the wreckers, while Hasân was glad to
escape on his sole surviving vessel.</p>

<p>Unable to subdue the Mainates by force, the Grand Vizier now had
recourse to diplomacy. The hereditary blood feud had long been the
curse of Maina, and its inhabitants were divided into the hostile factions
of the Stephanopouloi and the Iatraioi—the Montagues and Capulets of
that rugged land. At that time there was in Maina a certain Liberakes
Gerakares, who, after an apprenticeship in the Venetian fleet, had
turned his nautical experience to practical use as a pirate. In an interval
of his profession he had become engaged to a daughter of the clan of
Iatraioi, who boasted of their descent from one of the Florentine Medici,
formerly shipwrecked there; but, before the wedding had taken place,
a rival, belonging to the opposite clan, eloped with the lady. Smarting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
under his loss and burning for revenge upon the whole race of the
Stephanopouloi, the disappointed lover was accidentally captured by
the Turks at sea and carried off to prison. The crafty Köprili saw at
once that Liberakes was the very man for his purpose. He not only
released him, but provided him with money, and sent him back to
Maina in the capacity of his secret agent. Liberakes at once distributed
the pasha’s gold among his clansmen and proclaimed civil war against
the Stephanopouloi. At the same time the Mainates were told of favours
which the Grand Vizier had in store for them—the use of bells and
crosses outside their churches, the abolition of the tribute of children,
and the remission of half the capitation tax. No Turk, it was added,
should live among them.</p>

<p>As soon as Crete had fallen Köprili devoted his attention to the
accomplishment of his plan. He peremptorily summoned the Mainates,
under penalty of extermination, to submit to his authority, promising
them an amnesty and the remission of all arrears of tribute in case of
prompt submission. At the same time he despatched 6000 men to
Maina, with orders to treat the people well, but to build, under the
pretext of protecting trade, three forts in strong positions. As soon,
however, as the forts were finished, Liberakes and his men seized some
of their most prominent foes, while the Turks preserved an air of
complete indifference. After a mock trial the unfortunate Stephanopouloi
were sentenced to death as disturbers of the public peace. Those of them
who escaped emigrated to Corsica, where their descendants may still be
found at Cargèse. More than a century later they furnished to Bonaparte
agents for the dissemination of his plans of conquest in Greece. Other
Mainates went into exile in Tuscany, where their descendants soon
became fused with the Italian population, and in Apulia, while those who
remained behind were for the second time placed under Turkish authority.
Liberakes, as soon as his deluded countrymen had realised the device
of which they had been the victims, became so unpopular that he
took to piracy again. A second time captured by the Turks, he
was again imprisoned till his captors once more found need for his
services<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.</p>

<p>While Candia was the scene of the great struggle between Venice
and “the Ottomite,” Athens was once more coming within the ken of
Europe. At the beginning of the seventeenth century the French showed
much activity in the Levant, where they established consuls about that
time. In 1630 the French ambassador at Constantinople, Louis des<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
Hayes, had visited Athens<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>, of which a brief mention is made in his
travels, and in 1645 a very important step towards the “re-discovery”
of the famous city was taken. In that year a body of Jesuit missionaries
were sent thither, and though they subsequently removed to Negroponte,
because that place contained more Franks, they were followed
at Athens in 1658 by the Capuchins, whose name will ever be remembered
in connection with the topography of that city. In 1669 they bought the
choragic monument of Lysikrates, then colloquially known as “the
Lantern of Demosthenes,” which henceforth formed part of their
convent<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>. Over the entrance they placed the lilies of France, to which
the monument still belongs, and by whose care it has twice been restored;
but their hospitality was extended to strangers of all races and religions,
and it is curious to hear that the Turkish <i>cadi</i> would only sanction this
purchase of a national monument on condition that the Capuchins
promised not to injure it and to show it to all who wished to see it. The
monument itself was converted into a study, where Lord Byron passed
many an hour during his visit to Athens in 1811, and where he wrote
his famous indictment of Lord Elgin’s vandalism. The chapel of the
convent was, till the capture of the city by Morosini, the only Frankish
place of worship. But the worthy Capuchins did not confine themselves
to religious exercises. About the same time that they purchased the
choragic monument they drew up a plan of Athens, which was a great
advance on the imaginary representations of that place, which had
hitherto been devised to gratify the curiosity of Europe, and which had
depicted Athens now as a Flemish and now as a German town. Nor
did they keep their information to themselves. They communicated
their plan and a quantity of notes to a French literary man, Guillet, who
published them in the form of an imaginary journey, supposed to have
been undertaken by his brother, La Guilletière. The sources of Guillet’s
information render his narrative far more valuable than if he had merely
paid a flying visit to Athens; and though he never saw the place about
which he wrote he had at his command the best available materials,
compiled by men who had lived there. About the same time Babin, a
Jesuit who had also lived at Athens, drew up an account of it, which
was published by Dr Spon<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>, a physician and antiquary of Lyons, who
visited Greece in 1675 and 1676 in the company of an Englishman, Sir
George Wheler, and subsequently issued a detailed account of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
travels, upon which his travelling companion afterwards based an English
version. Two other Englishmen, Randolph and Vernon, also travelled
in Greece at different times between 1671 and 1679, and have left behind
records of their impressions. Besides these unofficial travellers Lord
Winchelsea, the British ambassador at Constantinople, paid a visit, of
which, however, he published no record, to Athens in 1675, while the
previous year had witnessed the tour of his French colleague, the
marquis de Nointel, through the Cyclades and Attica, in the company of
the painter Jacques Carrey, who drew for him the sculptures of the
Parthenon, and of an Italian, Cornelio Magni, who wrote an account of
the great man’s journey<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>. Thus we have ample opportunities for
judging what was the condition of Athens between the years 1669 and
1676, or shortly before the Venetian siege, while recent researches have
greatly elucidated the statements of the travellers.</p>

<p>The population of Athens at that time is estimated by Guillet at
between 15,000 and 16,000, of whom only 1000 or 1200 were Mussulmans,
and by Spon at between 8000 and 9000, of whom three-quarters
were Greeks and the rest Turks. A modern Greek scholar<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>, while
accepting Spon’s estimate of the proportion between the Greeks and the
Mussulmans, puts the total population at the time of the Venetian siege
at 20,000, which would better tally with the expression of a Hessian officer,
Hombergk, who was among the besiegers, and who wrote home that
Athens was “a very big and populous town.” Another German officer,
a Hanoverian, named Zehn, even went so far in his journal as to state
that Athens had “14,000 houses<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>,” which must be an exaggeration. In
1822 there were only 1238. It is clear, however, from all these estimates
that Athens was in 1687 a considerable place. Besides the Greeks and
Turks there were also a few Franks, some gipsies, and a body of negroes.
The negroes were the slaves of the Turks, living in winter at the foot
of the Akropolis, in the holes of the rock, in huts, or among the ruins
of old houses, and in summer, like the modern Athenians, spending
their spare time on the beach at Phaleron. The gipsies were particularly
odious to the Greeks as the tools of any Turk who wished to torture
them. Among the Franks were the consuls, of whom there were two.
At the time of Spon’s visit they were both Frenchmen and both deadly
enemies, M. Châtaignier, the representative of France, and M. Giraud,
a resident in Athens for the last eighteen years, who acted for England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
and was the <i>cicerone</i> of all travellers. A little later, in the reign of James II,
we were represented by one of our own countrymen, Launcelot Hobson,
one of whose servants, a native of Limehouse, together with two other
Englishmen, was buried at that time in the Church of St Mary’s-on-the-Rock
beneath a tombstone, now in the north wall of the English church,
commemorating his great linguistic attainments. Besides the two consuls
Spon found no other Franks at Athens, except one Capuchin monk, one
soldier, and some servants; a little earlier we hear of a German adventurer
as living there<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>.</p>

<p>Our authorities differ as to the feelings with which at that period the
Athenians regarded the Franks. Guillet, indeed, alludes to the excellent
relations between the Greeks and Latins, and points, as a proof of it,
to the remarkable fact that young Athenians were sent by their parents
to be educated by the Capuchins. The consul Giraud’s wife was also a
Greek. Spon, however, speaks of the great aversion of the Greeks to the
Franks<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>, and this is confirmed by an incident which followed the visit
of the marquis de Nointel to Athens in 1674. During his stay the pious
ambassador had had mass recited in the ancient temple of Triptolemos,
beyond the Ilissos, which, under the title of St Mary’s-on-the-Rock, had
served as a chapel of the Frank dukes<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>. After their time it had been
converted into a Greek church, but had been allowed to fall into disuse.
None the less it was considered by the Orthodox to have been profaned
by the masses of the French ambassador<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>. A great number of satirical
verses have been also preserved<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>, which show that the Frank residents
were the butt of every sharp-witted Athenian street boy, and their
cleanly habits were especially suspicious to the Orthodox. Besides, as
many of the pirates were Franks, the popular logic readily confounded
the two, and visited upon the harmless Latin the sins of some of his
co-religionists. It was manifest, however, at the time of the Venetian
siege that the Athenians preferred the Franks to the Turks, and every
traveller from the West praised the hospitality which the Greeks of
Athens showed to the foreigner. Spon tells us that there was not a single
Jew to be found in the city. Quite apart from the national hatred which
they inspired, and still inspire, in the Hellenic breast, how could they
outwit the Athenians<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>? Would they not have fared like their fellow
countrymen who landed one day on Lesbos, but, on observing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
astuteness of the Lesbian hucksters in the market-place, went off by
the next ship, saying that this was no place for them? On the other
hand a few Wallachs wandered about Athens, some Albanian Mussulmans
were employed in guarding the entrances to the town, and in all
the villages of Attica the inhabitants were of the Albanian race, as is
still largely the case<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>. In Athens itself all the non-Turkish and non-Hellenic
population did not amount at that time to more than 500.</p>

<p>A great change had taken place in the government of the city since
the early years of the seventeenth century. We last saw Athens forming
a district of the <i>sandjak</i> of Euripos, and dependent on the pasha of
Eubœa, who was represented there by a lower official. A document in
the Bodleian Library<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>, dated 1617, gives us, from the pen of a Greek
exile in England, an account of the exactions of a rapacious Turkish
governor of Athens somewhat earlier. In consequence of this bad
treatment the Athenians sent several deputations to Constantinople,
and about the year 1610 the efforts of their delegates received strong
support from one of those Athenian beauties who have from time to
time exercised sway over the rulers of Constantinople. A young girl,
named Basilike, who had become the favourite wife of Sultan Ahmed I,
had been requested by him to ask some favour for herself. The patriotic
Athenian, who had heard in her childhood complaints of the exactions
of the pasha of Euripos and his deputy, and perhaps primed by one of
the Athenian deputations which may then have been at Constantinople,
begged that her native city might be transferred to the <i>kislar-aga</i>, or
chief of the black eunuchs in the seraglio. The request was granted, and
thenceforth Athens, greatly to its material benefit, depended upon that
powerful official<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>. A <i>firman</i>, renewable on the accession of a new sultan,
spared the citizens the annual visitation of the pasha of Euripos, who
could only descend upon them when the issue of the precious document
was delayed. The <i>kislar-aga</i> was represented at Athens by a <i>voivode</i>, or
governor, and the other Turkish officials were the <i>disdar-aga</i>, or commander
of the garrison in the Akropolis, which shortly before the
Venetian war amounted to 300 soldiers; the <i>sardar</i> and the <i>spahilar-aga</i>,
who directed the Janissaries and the cavalry; the <i>cadi</i>; and the <i>mufti</i>.</p>

<p>The Athenians enjoyed, however, under this Turkish administration
an almost complete system of local self-government. Unlike the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
democratic Greece of to-day, where there is no aristocracy and where
every man considers himself the equal of his fellows, Turkish Athens
exhibited sharp class distinctions, which had at least the advantage of
furnishing a set of rulers who had the respect of the ruled. Under the
Turks the Greek population of the town was divided into four classes—the
<i>archontes</i>; the householders, who lived on their property; the shopkeepers,
organised, as now, in different guilds; and the cultivators of
the lands or gardens in the immediate suburbs, who also included in
their ranks those engaged in the important business of bee-keeping<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>.
The first of these four classes, into which members of the other three
never rose, had originally consisted of twelve families, representing—so
the tradition stated—the twelve ancient tribes of the fourth century
before Christ. Their number subsequently varied, but about this period
amounted to rather more than sixty. Among their names it is interesting
to find, though no longer in the very first rank, the family (which still
exists at Athens) of the Athenian historian Chalkokondyles, slightly
disguised under the form Charkondyles. More important were the
Benizeloi, said to be descended from the Acciajuoli, whose Christian
names occur frequently in their family, and the Palaiologoi, who boasted,
without much genealogical proof, of their connection with the famous
Imperial family. Some of the <i>archontes</i> went so far as to use the Byzantine
double eagle on their tombs, of which a specimen may still be seen in
the monastery of Kaisariane, and all wore a peculiar costume, of which
a fur cap was in later Turkish times a distinctive mark. Their flowing
locks and long beards gave them the majestic appearance of Greek
ecclesiastics, and the great name of Alexander was allowed to be borne
by them alone. This Athenian aristocracy is now all but extinct; yet
the names of localities round Athens still preserve the memory of these
once important families, and in Mount Skaramangka, near Salamis, and
in Pikermi, on the road to Marathon, we may trace the property of
<i>archontes</i>, who once owned those places, while in modern Athens the
names of streets commemorate the three great families of Chalkokondyles,
Benizelos and Limponas.</p>

<p>From this class of some sixty families the Christian administrators
of Athens were selected. Once a year, on the last Sunday in February,
all the citizens who paid taxes assembled outside St Panteleemon, which
was in Turkish times the metropolitan church, after a solemn service
inside; the principal householders and tradesmen and the heads of the
guilds then exchanged their views, and elected from the whole body of
<i>archontes</i> the chief officials for the ensuing year, the so-called δημογέροντες,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
or “elders of the people.” There is some difference of opinion
as to their numbers, which have been variously estimated at two, three,
four, eight and twenty-four. A recent Greek scholar has, however,
shown from the evidence of documents that they were three<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>. After
their election had been ratified by the <i>cadi</i> they entered upon the duties
of their office, which practically constituted an <i>imperium in imperio</i>.
They represented the Greek population before the Turkish authorities,
watched over the privileges of the city, looked after the schools and the
poor, cared for the widows and the orphans, and decided every Monday,
under the presidency of the metropolitan, such differences between the
Greeks as the litigants did not prefer to submit to the <i>cadi</i>. Their
decision was almost always sought by their fellow Christians, and even
in mixed cases, which came before the Turkish judge, they acted as the
counsel of the Greek party. They had the first seats everywhere; they
were allotted a special place in the churches, and when they passed the
people rose to their feet. Each of them received for his trouble 1000
piastres during his year of office, and they were entitled to levy a tax
upon salt for the expenses of the community. They sometimes combined
the usual vices of slaves with those of tyrants, fawning on the Turkish
officials and frowning on the Greek populace. But they often had the
courage to impeach the administration of some harsh governor at
Constantinople, and, like the rest of the class from which they sprang,
they sometimes made sacrifices of blood and treasure for their native
city. In addition to these “elders” there were eight other officials of less
age and dignity, called “agents,” or ἐπίτροποι, and elected from each
of the eight parishes into which Athens was then divided. These persons,
who were chosen exclusively from the class of <i>archontes</i>, acted as go-betweens
between the latter and the Turkish authorities.</p>

<p>Thus the English traveller Randolph was justified in asserting that
“the Greeks live much better here than in any other part of Turkey,
with the exception of Scio, being a small commonwealth among themselves<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>”;
or, as a modern writer has said of his countrymen, “the
Athenians did not always feel the yoke of slavery heavy<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>.” The taxes
were not oppressive, consisting of the <i>haratch</i>, or capitation tax, which
in Spon’s time was at the rate of five instead of four and a half piastres
a head, and of a tithe, both of which went to the <i>voivode</i>, who in turn
had to pay 30,000 crowns to the chief eunuch. There was also the terrible
tribute of children, from which Athens was not exempt, as has sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
been supposed, for the above-mentioned Lincoln College manuscript,
which had belonged to Sir George Wheler and was first published by
Professor Lampros, expressly mentions the arrival of the men to take
them<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>. But on the whole the condition of the Athenians, owing to the
influence of their powerful protector at Constantinople, was very
tolerable. When some of the principal Turkish officials of Athens
meditated the imposition of a new duty on Athenian merchandise, two
local merchants were sent to the then chief eunuch, with the result that
they obtained from him the punishment of their oppressors<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>. When the
Œcumenical Patriarch ordered the deposition of their metropolitan, the
Athenians persuaded the <i>kislar-aga</i> to get the order quashed<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>. We do
not know whether they felt with Gibbon that this august patronage
“aggravated their shame,” but it certainly “alleviated their servitude.”
At times, however, even the long arm of the chief eunuch could not
protect them from the vengeance of the enemies whom they had
denounced to him. Thus in 1678 the local Turks murdered Michael
Limponas, the most prominent citizen of Athens, who had just returned
from a successful mission, in which he had complained of their misdeeds
at Constantinople. A Cretan poet celebrated his death for his country,
and this <i>archon</i> of the seventeenth century may truly be included among
the martyrs of Greece<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>. It was noticed that, even in that age, the old
Athenian love of liberty had not been extinguished by more than four
centuries of Frankish and Turkish rule; the Attic air, it was said, still
made those who breathed it intolerant of authority. Babin remarked
that the Athenians had “a great opinion of themselves,” and that “if
they had their liberty they would be just as they are described by St Paul
in the Acts<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>.” Athens, he wrote, still possessed persons of courage and
virtue, such as the girl who received sixty blows of a knife rather than
lose her honour, and the child who died rather than apostatise.</p>

<p>The Athenians were very religious under the Turkish sway, and then,
as now, there were frequent pilgrimages to the Holy Land<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>. Sometimes
this religious feeling was prone to degenerate into superstition; for
example, Greeks and Turks alike believed that various epidemics lay
buried beneath the great marble columns of the ruined temples. In
short, the Athenian character was much what it might have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
expected to be. Industrious, musical, and hospitable, the Greeks of
Athens were admitted to be, and the virtue of the Athenian ladies
was no less admired than their good looks. But the satirical talents of
Aristophanes had descended to the Athenians of the seventeenth century;
no one could escape from the barbed arrows of their caustic wit, sometimes
poisoned with the spirit of envy; they ridiculed Turks, and Franks,
and Wallachs, and their own fellow-countrymen alike, and they
delighted in inflicting nicknames which stuck to their unhappy object.
Their love of money and astuteness in business may have given rise to
the current saying, “From the Jews of Thessalonika, the Turks of
Negroponte, and the Greeks of Athens, good Lord, deliver us.” In
striking contrast to the proverbial Turks of Eubœa, those resident in
Athens were usually amiable<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>. They generally agreed well with their
Greek neighbours, whose language they spoke very well. In fact, like
the Cretan Mussulmans of to-day, they knew only a few words of
Turkish, barely sufficient for their religious devotions, while some of the
Greeks were acquainted with the latter language. Sometimes the
Turkish residents would aid the Greeks to get rid of an unpopular
governor; and, when Easter and Bairam coincided, they would take a
fraternal interest in each other’s festivals. The Athenian Moslem drank
wine, like his Christian fellow, and his zeal for water and his respect for
trees were distinct benefits, the latter of which modern Athens has now
lost. There was, however, one notable exception to the general amiability
of the Turkish residents. The Greek population of Attica, as distinct
from the town, was much oppressed by the Turkish landlords, and
despised by the Greek townsfolk. One part of Athens, and that the holy
of holies, the venerable Akropolis, was exclusively reserved to the Turks,
and no <i>rayah</i> was allowed to enter it, not because of its artistic treasures,
but because it was a fortress. Archæological researches there were
regarded with grave suspicion<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.</p>

<p>Education was not neglected by the Athenians of the seventeenth
century. From 1614 to 1619 and again in 1645 a wayward Athenian
genius, named Korydalleus, was teaching philosophy to a small class
there. A Greek, resident in Venice, founded a school there in 1647, and
in Spon’s time there were three schoolmasters—among them Demetrios
Benizelos, who had studied in Venetia—employed in giving lectures
in rhetoric and philosophy, while many young Greeks went to the classes
of the Capuchins. Babin tells us, however, that Benizelos (whose father,
Angelos, and younger brother, Joannes, were also teachers) had “only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
two or three hearers, everyone being now occupied in amassing a little
money.” We hear of a Greek monk who was acquainted with Latin;
but Spon could find only three people in Athens who understood ancient
Greek<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>. A century earlier, as we saw, correspondents of Kraus had
commented on the badness of the Attic Greek of their day. Yet,
according to Guillet, it was by this time “the purest and least corrupt
idiom in Greece,” and “Athenian phrases and a Nauplian accent” were
commended as the perfection of Greek. Externally too Athens was no
mere barbarous collection of huts. The houses were of stone, and better
built than those of the Morea; and a picture which has been preserved<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
of an <i>archon’s</i> house of the later Turkish period, constructed round a
court with trees and a fountain in the middle, shows the influence of
Mussulman taste on the Athenian aristocracy. The solid construction
of the houses, and the name of “towers” (πύργοι) given to the country
villas of the <i>archontes</i>, as in the island of Andros to the present day,
were both due to the prevalence of piracy, then the curse of Athens.
But the streets were unpaved and narrow—an arrangement better
adapted, however, to the fierce heat of an Attic summer than the wide
thoroughfares of the modern Greek capital. The town was then divided
into eight parishes, or <i>platómata</i>, the name of one of which, Plaka, survives,
and contained no fewer than fifty-two churches and five mosques.
Among the latter were the Parthenon, or “Mosque of the Castle,”
the minaret of which figures conspicuously in the contemporary
plans, and the “Mosque of the Conqueror,” now used as the military
bakery, which had been converted from a church by Mohammed II<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>.
The most important of the former was the metropolitan church, the
Καθολικόν, as it was then called, usually identified with the small
building which still bears that name, but supposed by Kampouroglos
to have been that of St Panteleemon<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>. Although the clergy had less
influence at Athens than in some other parts of Greece, the metropolitan,
as we have seen, was a personage of political importance; he received
at that time 4000 crowns a year, and had under his jurisdiction the five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
bishops of Salona, Livadia, Boudonitza, Atalante and Skyros. The
monastery of Kaisariane, or Syriane, on Hymettos, or “Deli-Dagh” (the
“Mad Mountain”), as the Turks called it, still paid only one <i>sequin</i> to
the <i>voivode</i> in consideration of the fact that its abbot had presented
the keys of Athens to Mohammed II at the time of the conquest<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>. The
Catholic archbishopric of Athens had, however, ceased to exist on the
death of the last Archbishop in 1483, and the churches and monasteries
which had belonged to it in Frankish days had been recovered by the
Orthodox Greeks.</p>

<p>Although the Ilissos even then, as now, contained very little water,
there were a number of gardens along its banks above the town, with
country houses at Ambelokepoi, and the excellent air and its freedom
from plague at that period made Athens a healthy residence, where
doctors could not make a living<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>. There were still some rich merchants;
but the trade of Athens was mainly limited to the agricultural produce
of the neighbourhood, to the export of oil, and to a little silk, imported
from other parts and woven in private houses. Randolph mentions that,
in 1671, an inspector from Constantinople found about 50,000 olive
trees in the plain, and some of the olives were esteemed so delicious that
they were reserved for the Sultan’s table. The oil was excellent, and was
exported every year to Marseilles. Athens also supplied cotton sail-cloth
to the Turkish navy<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>. As for the wine, though good, it was voted
undrinkable by all the travellers of that period, owing to the resin with
which it was impregnated<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>. Honey was still as famous a product of
Hymettos as in classic ages, and the monks of Kaisariane were specially
renowned for their hives. Trade being thus small, it is not surprising
that few Franks resided at Athens. Such as it was, it was entirely in
Greek hands.</p>

<p>The monuments of Athens had not then suffered from the havoc so
soon to be wrought by the bombs of Morosini. When Des Hayes was
there the Parthenon was as entire and as little damaged by the injuries
of time as if it had only just been built. The Turks, whatever their
faults may have been, had shown great respect for the venerable relics
of ancient Athens, which had now been in their power for two centuries.
When a piece of the frieze of Phidias fell they carefully placed it inside
the Parthenon, the interior of which was at that time entirely whitewashed<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>;
the external appearance of that noble temple, as it then was,
can be judged from the published drawings of Carrey. The Akropolis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
was fortified, and occupied by the garrison, whose houses, about 200
in number, covered a portion of its surface, and the Odeion of Herodes
Atticus (then called Serpentzes) was joined by a wall with and formed
a bulwark of it. The Propylæa served as the residence of the commander,
the <i>disdar-aga</i>, whose harem was in the Erechtheion<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>, and the Temple
of Wingless Victory had been converted into a powder magazine.
Unfortunately the Turks had also stored their ammunition in the
Propylæa, and in 1656 a curious accident caused it to explode. At that
time Isouf Aga, the commander of the Akropolis and a bitter enemy of
the Greeks, had vowed that he would destroy the little church of St
Demetrios, on the opposite hill. One evening, before going to bed, he
ordered two or three pieces of artillery to be put in position to fire on
the church in the morning. But in the night a thunderbolt ignited the
powder magazine. The Aga and nearly all his family perished by the
force of the explosion, and—what was a more serious loss—part of the
roof was destroyed. The Greeks ascribed the disaster to the righteous
indignation of the saint, whose church was thenceforth, and is still,
called St Demetrios the Bombardier<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>. On another occasion, so it was
said, when a Turk fired a shot at an eikon of the Virgin in the Parthenon
his arm withered, while another Mussulman was reported to have
dropped dead in the attempt to open two great cupboards, closed with
blocks of marble and let into the walls<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>. For the great Temple of
Olympian Zeus the Turks had a becoming regard, and at the solemn
season of Bairam they used to meet near its columns to pray. The
Areopagos, from the spring of “black water” still to be found there,
they called <i>Kara-su</i>. Less scrupulous than the Turks, De Nointel took
two workmen about with him on his tour, and carried off several pieces
of marble, just as the Jesuits had taken with them to Chalkis some of the
marble fragments of Athens to serve as monuments in their cemetery<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>.</p>

<p>The Piræus, which had played so great a part in the life of ancient
Athens, consisted at that time of only a single house—a magazine for
storing goods and levying the duties on them<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>. Its classical name had
been lost, and while the Franks called it Porto Leone the Greeks styled
it Porto Drako<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>, from the huge lion, now in front of the arsenal at Venice,
upon which Harold Hardraada had once scrawled his name, and which
attracted the attention of all travellers. The foundations of the famous
Long Walls were still visible almost all the way, and on the road to
Eleusis there was another fine marble lion, which can be traced in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
Capuchins’ plan. The monastery of Daphni had been almost entirely
abandoned, owing to the ravages of corsairs, Christians as well as Turks,
and the former had driven away all the inhabitants of Eleusis; but the
monastery of Phaneromene, in Salamis, had just been restored by
Laurentios of Megara in 1670, and a little later, in 1682, the church at
Kaisariane was decorated with fresh paintings by a Peloponnesian
artist at the expense of the Benizeloi who had fled thither for fear of the
plague, and to whom the monastery and the present summer pleasaunce
of Kephissia formerly belonged. All along the shore near Phaleron
stood towers, where men watched day and night to give the alarm
against the pirates. Such was the terror inspired by those marauders
that not a single Turk resided at Megara, and there was only one house
between that place and Corinth. The <i>Kakè Skála</i> maintained its classic
reputation as a haunt of robbers, and descendants of the fabulous
brigand Skiron were in the habit of lurking there, so that the Turks
were afraid to travel along that precipitous road where the railway now
passes above the sea. Akrocorinth, in spite of its ruinous condition, was,
however, a sure refuge of the Mussulmans against the corsairs, while
Lepanto, on the other hand, was a perfect nest of pirates<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the Greek provincial towns at that period Chalkis, with a population
of about 15,000, was the most important. It was the residence
of the capitan pasha and the scene of the Jesuits’ missionary labours.
They had established a school there, after their departure from Athens,
and the children of the seven or eight Frank families who still resided
in the old Venetian town gave them more occupation than they had
found at their former abode. The castle was entirely given over to the
Turks and Jews, and the traveller Randolph mentions in his day the
rich carving of some of the houses, which I have myself seen there.
Patras, famous for its citrons, contained some 4000 or 5000 inhabitants,
one-third of whom were Jews, and the latter had three synagogues at
Lepanto, which had the whole trade of the gulf, though they were less
numerous there than at Patras. Corinth was then, like the modern town,
a big village with a population of 1500, and it was noted for the numbers
of conversions to Islâm which had taken place there. Like Athens, it
had no Jews. Nauplia, the residence of the pasha of the Morea, was
a large town, but Sparta was “quite forsaken<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>.” Delphi, then called
Kastri, was the fief of a Turk, and produced cotton and tobacco. The
neighbouring town of Salona contained seven mosques and six churches,
and at the splendid Byzantine monastery of Hosios Loukas there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
about 150 monks. Thebes was then about the same size as at present,
and had no more than 3000 or 4000 inhabitants, while its rival, Livadia,
provided all Greece with wool, corn and rice. Somewhat earlier it had
furnished sail-cloth for the Ottoman navy<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>, and in the Turkish period it
enjoyed considerable liberty, being administered by a δημογέρωον, or
elder, who, with the assistance of the leading citizens, successfully
resisted any intervention from outside in the affairs of his native city<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>.
In the Morea, where there were only 30,000 Turks, and nearly all those
Greek-speaking, each town was managed by its own Greek elders, who
levied the taxes. Spon found there four metropolitans, whose sees were
respectively Patras, Nauplia, Corinth and Mistra, and he remarks, as
every modern traveller in the country districts of Greece cannot fail to
do, on the strict fasts observed by the Orthodox. He found that the
sole exception was in the case of those who were subjects of Venice and
who had imbibed the laxer ideas of Roman Catholicism; as for the others,
they would rather die than dine in Lent<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>. The value of the Peloponnesian
trade may be judged from the fact that an English consul, Sir H. Hide,
had lately resided at Glarentza and had built a church there<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>.</p>

<p>The former duchy of Naxos, then a Turkish <i>sandjak</i>, had been lightly
treated by the Turks since their final conquest of the islands. In 1580
Murad III had given the islanders many privileges, permitting them to
build churches and monasteries and to use bells, while forbidding the
Turks to settle among them, a provision which has done much to keep
the Cyclades free from all traces of Mussulman rule. Once a year, and
once only, came the capitan pasha to levy the tribute of the islands at
Paros; but the tribute was raised by the insular municipalities, whose
powers of self-government were not disturbed by the Turkish conquerors.
The inhabitants of some islands were, however, bound to send
a fixed quantity of their produce to Constantinople every year<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>. These
privileges were confirmed by Ibrahim in 1640, and we may form some
idea of the state of the Cyclades from the amount of the capitation tax
levied upon them at the date of Spon’s tour. Naxos was then assessed
at 6000 <i>piastres</i>, out of which the governor had to provide one galley
to the Turkish fleet; Andros paid 4500, with which one galley was
equipped, while Eubœa paid 100,000 <i>piastres</i>, and the Morea was bound
to furnish three vessels<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>. At that time the Venetian island of Tenos was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
the best cultivated, the most prosperous, and the most densely populated
of all the Cyclades, because the banner of St Mark protected it from the
Christian corsairs, whose chief rendezvous was at Melos, and who
captured, among others, the English traveller Vernon. Tenos then
contained twenty-four villages, the inhabitants of which, 20,000 in
number, speaking Greek, but almost entirely of the Catholic religion,
were exclusively employed in the manufacture of silk. Randolph, who
visited this island in 1670, found it to have “ever been a great eyesore
to the Turks,” especially during the Candian war, when a certain Giorgio
Maria, a Corsican privateer in the Venetian service, had manned his
ships with the islanders of Tenos, and had plagued the enemies of the
Republic as none had done since Skanderbeg. Tenos had quite recovered
from the raid which the Turks had made upon it in 1658; but since the
war its inhabitants had thought it prudent to offer the capitan pasha a
<i>douceur</i> of 500 dollars, in addition to the regular tithe which they paid
to Venice<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>. The only thing on Delos was the colony of rabbits. Mykonos,
which Venetian ships still frequented, had not a single Turk, and the
chief profession of its inhabitants was piracy, which kept so many of the
men engaged at sea that there was an enormous disproportion between
the females and the males.</p>

<p>Corsairs were indeed the terror of the Ægean, as was natural now
that the Candian war was over and they had no more scope for the
legitimate exercise of their talents. Thus in 1673 a Savoyard, the
marquis de Fleuri, set out to take Paros, but was captured by the
Venetians in pursuance of their pledge, given to the Turks at the late
peace, not to tolerate piracy in the Archipelago. Another freebooter,
a Provençal, named Hugues Creveliers, who served as the original of
Lord Byron’s <i>Corsair</i>, and had roamed about the Levant from boyhood,
succeeded in making Paros his headquarters, after a futile attempt upon
a Turkish fort in Maina, and scoured the Ægean with a fleet of twenty
ships for two whole years, levying blackmail upon Megara and defying
capture, till at last he was blown up in his flagship by a servant whom
he had offended. Another pirate, a Greek, named Joannes Kapsi, made
himself master of Melos in 1677, but was taken and hanged by the Turks
in 1680. Nevertheless the lot of the Melians was so hard that a party
of them, together with some Samians, emigrated to London, under the
guidance of their Archbishop Georgirenes of Melos, author of <i>A Description
of the present state of Samos, Nicaria, Patmos, and Mount Athos</i>.
It is to this colony that Greek Street owes its name, for the Duke of
York, the future King James II, assigned that site to them as a residence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
and in Hog Lane, afterwards called Crown Street, Soho, they built a
Greek church—the first in London<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>. Even where the privateers did not
come the Turks took care to “hinder the islanders from becoming too
rich.”</p>

<p>The Latin population of the Cyclades had not diminished, though
a century had elapsed since the last of the Latin dukes had fallen; on
the contrary, it had increased, in consequence of the emigration thither
after the Turkish conquest of Crete. Naxos and Santorin were the chief
seats of these Latin survivors, who were sedulously guarded by the
Roman Church. Down to the seventeenth century a Latin bishopric
was maintained in Andros, and one still exists at Santorin, another at
Syra, and a third at Tenos. In 1626 the Jesuits, and nine years later the
Capuchins, obtained a convent in Naxos, which was placed under the
protection of France; and after the fall of Rhodes the Latin archbishopric
was removed to the same island<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>, where the Catholics held much property.
But this concentration of Catholicism in Naxos had some most unfortunate
results, which were happily lacking in the less strenuous
atmosphere of Santorin. The Latins of the upper town of Naxos looked
down contemptuously upon the Greek inhabitants of the lower city;
they refused to intermarry with the Orthodox; and if a Catholic changed
his religion for that of the despised Greeks he was sure of persecution
by his former co-religionists. In the country, where old feudal usages
still prevailed, the Latin nobles oppressed the Greek peasants; while,
like truly oriental tyrants, they were as servile to the Turks as they were
haughty to the Greeks. Worst of all, their feuds became hereditary, and
thus this little island community was plunged in almost endless bloodshed.
For example, towards the close of the seventeenth century the
leader of the Latin party in Naxos was Francesco Barozzi, whose family
had come thither from Crete about the beginning of the same century,
and whose surname I have found still preserved in the monuments of
the Catholic church in the upper town. Barozzi had married the
daughter of the French consul, who was naturally a person of consequence
among the Catholics of Naxos. But the lady was one day
insulted by Constantine Cocco, a member of a Venetian family which
had become thoroughly grecised. Barozzi, furious at the slight, took
a terrible vengeance, and not long afterwards Cocco was murdered by
his orders, and his body horribly mutilated. Cocco’s relatives thereupon
murdered the French consul; the consul’s widow persuaded a Maltese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
adventurer, Raimond de Modène, who had recently arrived on a frigate
belonging to the Knights of St John, and who was in love with her
daughter, to bombard the Cocco family with the ship’s cannon in the
monastery of Ipsili, where they had taken refuge. At last the vendetta
ended as a dramatist would have wished. The daughter of the murdered
Cocco, who was only one year old at the time of her father’s assassination,
married the son of her father’s murderer. For many years the
couple lived happily together, and the wife was the first woman in the
Archipelago to wear Frankish dress. But, though the fatal feud was
thus appeased, poetic vengeance, in the shape of the Turks, fell upon
the assassin’s son. His riches attracted their attention; he was thrown
into prison, and died at Naxos a beggar<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of Greece when, in 1684, the outbreak of war
between Venice and Turkey led to the temporary re-conquest of a large
part of the country by the soldiers of the West and the reappearance of
the lion of St Mark in the Morea.</p>

<span class="smaller">1684-1718</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In 1684, after the lapse of 144 years, Venice once more began to be
a power upon the Greek continent. She had long had grievances
against the Porte, such as the non-deliverance of prisoners and the
violation of her commercial privileges, while the Porte complained of
the raids of the Dalmatian Morlachs. Excuses for war were not, therefore,
lacking, and the moment was favourable. Sobieski, the year before,
had defeated the Turks before Vienna, and the Republic knew that she
would not lack allies. A “Holy League” was formed between the
Emperor, Poland, and Venice under the protection of Pope Innocent XI,
and the Tsar was specially invited to join. Accordingly, the Republic
declared war upon the Sultan, and appointed Francesco Morosini
captain-general of her forces.</p>

<p>Morosini, although sixty-six years of age, possessed an experience
of Turkish warfare upon Greek soil which compensated for his lack of
youth. He had served for twenty-three years in the armies and fleets
of his country, and had commanded at Candia till he felt himself
compelled to come to terms with the Turks, for which skilful piece of
diplomacy he was put upon his trial at home and, although acquitted,
left for fifteen years in retirement. Now that his countrymen needed a
commander, they bethought them of the man who had been so severely
criticised for the loss of Crete.</p>

<p>The Republic at this time still retained a considerable insular
dominion in Greek waters—six out of the seven Ionian islands, Tenos,
and the three Cretan fortresses of Grabusa, Suda and Spinalonga—but
on the Greek mainland only Butrinto and Parga, the two continental
dependencies of Corfù. She possessed, therefore, at Corfù, a base of
operations, and thither Morosini repaired. The huge mortars on either
side of the gate of the “old fortress” still bear the date of his visit—1684.
His first objective was the seventh Ionian island of Santa Maura,
particularly obnoxious to the Venetians as a nest of corsairs. Warmly
supported by Ionian auxiliaries, among whom are mentioned the
countrymen of Odysseus, he speedily obtained the surrender of Santa
Maura, which carried with it the acquisition of Meganisi, the home of
the Homeric Taphians, which was given as a fief to the Cephalonian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
family of Metaxas, Kalamos, and the other smaller islands lying off
the coast of Akarnania, and the submission of the Akarnanian population
of Baltos and Xeromeros, as his secretary and historiographer,
Locatelli<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>, informs us. Mesolonghi, not yet famous in history, was next
taken. The surrender of Prevesa, which followed, gave the Venetians
the command of the entrance to the Ambrakian Gulf, and completed
the first season’s operations. During the winter a treaty<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> with the duke
of Brunswick, father of our George I, for the supply of Hanoverian
soldiers, was concluded; other small German princelings sold their
soldiers at 200 francs a head, and when Morosini took the field in the
following summer the so-called Venetian army, in which Swedish,
German and French were as well understood as Italian, consisted of
3100 Venetians, Prince Maximilian William of Brunswick and 2400
Hanoverians, 1000 Maltese, 1000 Slavs, 400 Papal and 400 Florentine
troops. We may compare it with the composite Austro-Hungarian army
of our own time, in which many different races received orders in a
language, and fought for a cause, not their own. Morosini also entered
into negotiations with two Greek communities noted for their intolerance
of Turkish rule—the people of Cheimarra in northern Epeiros, of whom
we have heard much of late years, and the Mainates, who presented an
address to him. The former defeated a Turkish force that was sent
against them, the latter were temporarily checked by the fact that the
Turks held their children as hostages for their good behaviour<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>. Morosini
succeeded, however, in forcing the Turks to surrender the old Venetian
colony of Koron, whence an inscription of its former Venetian governors
dated 1463 was sent in triumph to Venice<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>, and his success encouraged
the Mainates to assist him in besieging the fortresses of Zarnata,
Kielapha and Passavâ. All three, together with the port of Vitylos and
the town of Kalamata, surrendered or were abandoned by their garrisons,
but a historian of Frankish Greece cannot but deplore the destruction
of the two famous castles of Kalamata and Passavâ. Morosini visited
that romantic spot, and by his orders the strongest parts of the fortifications
were destroyed. In the campaign of 1686, Morosini, assisted by
the Swedish field-marshal, Otto William von Koenigsmark, as commander
of the land forces, was even more successful. Old and New
Navarino opened their gates to his soldiers, who found over the gate of
the old town a reminiscence of the days when it had been a dependency of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
the Venetian colony of Modon in the shape of two coats-of-arms, those
of Morosini and Malipiero<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>, the latter belonging to the governor of 1467
or to his namesake of 1489. Modon thereupon surrendered, and, although
Monemvasia, the Gibraltar of the Morea, held out, the season closed with
the capture of Nauplia, at that time the Turkish capital of the peninsula
and residence of the tax-farmer, who collected the rents paid to the
Sultan Valideh, or queen-mother, from that province. The Greek
inhabitants expressed joy at returning, after the lapse of 146 years,
under Venetian rule, and Father Dambira, a Capuchin, arrived on a
mission from the Athenians, offering to pay a ransom, if they might be
spared the horrors of a siege. Morosini asked for 40,000 reals annually
for the duration of the war; but a second Athenian deputation, headed
by the Metropolitan Jacob, and comprising the notables Stamati Gaspari,
whose origin was Italian, Michael Demakes, George Dousmanes, and a
resident alien named Damestre, succeeded in persuading him to accept
9000. He sailed to the Piræus, collected the first annual instalment and
returned to Nauplia. In view of the prominent part played by General
Dousmanes during the late war, it is interesting to find a member of
his family among the Athenian deputies. It was not, however, of
Athenian origin. <i>Dushman</i> in Serbian means “enemy,” and in 1404 the
family is described as owning the Albanian district of Pulati, where a
village, named Dushmani, still exists<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>. The Turkish government compelled
the Œcumenical Patriarch to depose the Metropolitan Jacob for
his participation in this mission and his philo-Venetian sentiments. But
the Athenians refused to accept his successor, Athanasios, whereupon
the patriarch excommunicated them and their favourite metropolitan.</p>

<p>The next year completed the conquest of the Morea, with the
exception of Monemvasia. The Turks abandoned Patras; the two castles
at either side of the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth and the former
Venetian stronghold of Lepanto on the north of it were occupied; the
Moslems burnt the lower town of Corinth, where the Venetians found
“the great statue of the god Janus, not, however, quite intact, and
some architraves of fine stone<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>.” No attempt was made to defend the
magnificent fortress of Akrocorinth, and Morosini was able to examine
undisturbed the old wall across the isthmus and to consider the
possibility, realised in 1893, of cutting a canal which should join the
Corinthian and Saronic Gulfs<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>. The surrender of Castel Tornese, the
mint of the mediæval Morea, and of Mistra, the former capital of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
Byzantine province, justified his secretary<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> in saying that by August,
1687, Venice was “possessor of all the Morea, except Monemvasia.”
His successes had been partly due to the fact that the best Turkish
troops were engaged in the war in Hungary, and his losses from disease
had been fearful. But such was the joy of his government, that a bronze
bust, with the proud title of “Peloponnesiacus,” was erected to him in
his lifetime in the Doges’ Palace, where, like the monument to him at
Corfù, it still remains to remind the visitor of the Republic’s last attempt
to establish herself in the Morea.</p>

<p>But the conquest of the Morea no longer satisfied the usually
cautious Venetians. Leaving Monemvasia behind him, Morosini held
a council of war at Corinth, in which it was decided that, as it was too
late in the season to attack the old Venetian island of Negroponte,
Athens should be the next objective, as an Athenian deputation
suggested. Morosini himself was opposed to this plan. He pointed out
the drawbacks of even a successful attack upon Athens; it would be
necessary, he argued, to provision his army entirely from the sea, as
the Turkish commander at Thebes could intercept his communications
by land; it would be impossible from Athens to protect the entrance to
the Morea, as long as the Turks could occupy Megara; while, if it were
necessary to abandon Athens, not only would the Greek inhabitants
suffer at the hands of the Turks, but the Venetian exchequer would lose
the annual contribution which the Athenian notables had promised to
pay. His proposal was to keep a considerable force at Corinth, where
food was plentiful, and to send the rest of his army into winter quarters
at Tripolitsa in the centre of the Morea, where there was plenty of
forage and whence the Venetian domination over the peninsula—the
main object of the expedition—could be best established upon solid
foundations. Events proved Morosini’s forecast to have been accurate.
The council, however, decided upon a compromise: the army was to go
into three separate winter quarters—at Corinth, Tripolitsa, and Nauplia—but
first an attempt was to be made upon Athens, unless that city
would pay a ransom of 50,000 to 60,000 reals<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>. No time was lost in
carrying out this decision. Most of the fleet under Venier was sent to
the channel which separates Negroponte from the mainland, with the
object of deluding the Turks into the belief that that island was the aim
of Morosini’s forces. Meanwhile Morosini, with 9880 men (including one
or two Scottish volunteers) and 870 horses, on September 21, 1687, cast
anchor in the Piræus, Porto Leone, as it was then called from the statue
of a lion which stood at its mouth. Thither a deputation of Athenian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
notables, the brothers Peter and Demetrios Gaspari, Spyridon Peroules,
the schoolmaster Dr Argyros Benaldes, and others hastened to make
submission to Venice<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>. Although Sir Paul Rycaut, as the result of
eighteen years’ diplomatic experience in Turkey, wrote in that very
year, that “the Greeks have an inclination to the Muscovite beyond any
other Christian prince,” there was a special reason for the popularity of
Venice at Athens. Many young Athenians had been educated at the
Flangineion at Venice, and the recent outrage of the Turks upon the
Athenian notable, Limponas, made the Greeks eager to welcome any
Christians who would free them from their Moslem rulers.</p>

<p>The Turks were not unprepared for the Venetian invasion. They had
taken down the beautiful temple of Nike Apteros and out of its materials
raised the walls of the Akropolis and built a battery. Fortunately,
although there was a powder magazine underneath it, the venerable
stones of this temple received no damage during the siege. When, in
1836, the Bavarian architects reconstructed it, they found not a single
block missing (except what Lord Elgin had carried off) nor a bullet-mark
upon it<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>. Within the Akropolis, thus strengthened, the Turkish
inhabitants of Athens took refuge with their effects and ammunition,
hoping that “the castle” would hold out until relief could arrive from
Thebes. The Venetians were, therefore, able to occupy lower Athens
unmolested. Col. Raugraf von der Pfalz with a body of Slav and
Hanoverian troops was stationed in the town; Koenigsmark encamped
in the olive-grove near the Sacred Way, along which the Turkish force
might be expected to march through the pass of Daphni from Thebes.
As the garrison of the Akropolis refused to surrender, it was decided to
bombard that sacred rock. Archæologists and historians cannot but be
horrified at this act of vandalism. But in our own day we have seen
the “cultured” Germans bombarding the cathedral of Rheims, and the
“gentlemanly” Austrians dropping grenades close to St Mark’s at
Venice, while “military necessities” involved the firing of projectiles
over the Parthenon by the Allies in the crisis of December, 1916. The
Venetian engineers accordingly placed their batteries on the Mouseion
hill, upon which stands the monument of Philopappos, on the Pnyx,
and at the foot of the Areopagos, and on September 23 the bombardment
began<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the batteries, Mottoni, Count di San Felice,
was a notoriously incompetent gunner, as he had already proved at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
Navarino and Modon, and on this occasion his aim was so high that the
bombs flew over the Akropolis and fell into the town beyond it, whose
inhabitants claimed compensation for the damage to their houses. A
fresh battery of two mortars was accordingly placed on the east and
closer to the rock, while the miners attempted to drive a tunnel under
the north wall and above the grotto of Aglauros. This attempt was,
however, frustrated by the hardness of the rock, the fire of the besieged
and the fatal fall of the miner’s captain from a cliff. The bombardment
now, however, began to damage the buildings on the Akropolis. On
the 25th a bomb exploded a small powder magazine in the Propylæa,
and a deserter betrayed to the besiegers the fatal secret that the Turks
had put all the rest of their ammunition in the Parthenon, then a
mosque. Upon the receipt of this news the gunners concentrated their
fire upon the famous temple; and, on the evening of the 26th, a lieutenant
from Lüneburg fired a bomb into it. The explosion was so violent that
fragments of the building were hurled into the besiegers’ lines, whence
cries of joy in various languages rose at the destruction wrought in a
moment to a masterpiece that had survived almost intact the vicissitudes
of over twenty centuries. But even among the besiegers there were
some who mourned the havoc wrought by the German gunner’s too
accurate aim. Morosini, in his official report to his government, merely
alludes to it as a “fortunate shot,” and his secretary remarks that the
“ancient, splendid and marvellous temple of Minerva” was “ruined in
some parts”; but a Swedish lady, Anna Akerhjelm<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>, who accompanied
Countess von Koenigsmark to Greece and was then at Athens, has told
in her interesting correspondence “how repugnant it was” to Koenigsmark
“to destroy the beautiful temple,” which “can never in this world
be replaced.” So much did von Ranke feel this act of vandalism
committed by one of his countrymen, that he tried to discredit the diary
of the Hessian lieutenant, Sobiewolsky, which mentions the Lüneburg
gunner’s fatal shot. For the moment it failed to attain even the practical
effect of ending the siege. The Turks, expecting the arrival of their
deliverer from Thebes, still held out; but when Koenigsmark went to
meet the advancing army and its commander retired without a blow,
when the fire, caused by the explosion, had blazed for two days on the
Akropolis, where over 300 putrifying corpses, including those of their
commander and his son, lay beneath the ruins of the Parthenon, they
hoisted the white flag and sent five hostages to ask for a cessation of
hostilities. Morosini’s official dispatch informs us that he was inclined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
to insist upon their unconditional surrender, but that Koenigsmark
pointed out the importance of having possession of the Akropolis and
the proved difficulty of taking so strong a position by force. Accordingly,
he unwillingly granted them five days, at the end of which all the Turks
were to evacuate the fortress with only what they could carry on their
backs, leaving to the victors their horses, arms, Christian slaves, and
Moors. To prevent their joining their comrades at Negroponte, they
were to proceed to Smyrna at their own expense on board an English
pink, then in the Piræus, three Ragusan, and two French vessels. These
terms were settled on the 29th, the lion-banner of St Mark was at once
hoisted on the Propylæa, and punctually, on October 4, about 3000
Turks, including 500 soldiers, embarked. More than 300 others remained
behind and were baptised Christians. Despite Morosini’s and Koenigsmark’s
express orders the exiles were insulted by the officers and soldiers
of the auxiliaries on their way down to the Piræus, and some of their
women and children, as well as their bundles, were taken from them.
Count Tomaso Pompei<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> was appointed governor of “the castle” with
a Venetian garrison, while the rest of the Venetians and the auxiliaries
were quartered in the town below. Morosini himself was anxious to
attack Negroponte at once, while the Turks were still dismayed at the
loss of Athens; but Koenigsmark argued that they had not sufficient
forces to take that island. As the Morea was visited by a serious epidemic,
it was decided to go back upon the plans fixed in the council at Corinth,
and to pass the winter at Athens. To ensure communications with the
sea, part of the famous Long Walls was sacrificed to build three redoubts
on the way down to the Piræus, and a wall and ditch were drawn from
Porto Leone to the bay of Phaleron, to serve as an entrenched camp in
case of need. During these excavations ancient copper coins, vases, and
lamps were discovered.</p>

<p>Athens had, therefore, become for the third, the Akropolis for the
second time, Venetian, for Venice had occupied both town and castle
from 1394 to 1402 and the town in 1466, and it is interesting to see what
impression the famous city made upon the captors. One of Morosini’s
officers wrote that he “fell into an extasy” on gazing upon the magnificence
of the Parthenon even in its ruin, and his secretary, Locatelli,
devotes ten pages to the antiquities of Athens. Both he and two other
officers mention some of the classic buildings by the popular names
current for centuries—for we find some of them at the time of the
Turkish, some even at that of the Frankish conquest. These descriptions,
evidently based on the tales of the local guides, allude to the Temple of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
Olympian Zeus, which then had seventeen columns standing, under the
name of the “Palace of Hadrian,” the monument of Philopappos under
that of the “Arch of Trajan,” the gate of Athena Archegetis under that
of the “Temple of Augustus or Arch of Triumph,” the adjacent Porch
of Hadrian under that of the “Temple of Olympian Zeus,” and the
Pinakotheke under that of the “Arsenal of Lycurgus.” The Tower
of the Winds figures as the “Gymnasium of Sokrates,” the choragic
monument of Lysikrates as the “Lantern of Demosthenes.” The marble
lion at the Piræus, they tell us, had been “transported there in honour
of Leonidas,” while the statue of the tongueless lioness which stood
towards the sea, commemorated Leaina, the mistress of Harmodios and
Aristogeiton, who had bitten out her tongue rather than betray them
under torture<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>. These accounts are a curious contribution to the
<i>Mirabilia</i> of Athens; but, despite this casual display of popular erudition,
the army was not archæologically minded, the Germans less so than the
more cultured Venetians. A Hessian ensign<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> wrote home to his mother
mainly about food, regretting that the excellent fresh vegetables were
over, wishing that he had a cask of German beer instead of a cask of
Athenian wine, and telling her that he had drunk her health in “the
temple of the celebrated Demosthenes” (the choragic monument of
Lysikrates), which the Capuchins had bought eighteen years earlier and
in which his colonel was lodged. He added that he had often dined at
Corinth in the temple in which St Paul preached, and that Athens
produced grapes of the size described in the Old Testament. Nor do we
obtain much archæological information from the observant companion
of Countess von Koenigsmark. She wrote that her mistress’s bad
attack of measles had prevented her from making notes in her journal
of the antiquities which she had seen. “Besides,” she added, “there are
several descriptions of them,” and she specially alluded to the recent
work of Spon and Wheler. As for the archæological knowledge of the
Greek inhabitants, she wrote that “you cannot find any of them who
know as much about their ancestors as foreigners do<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>.” In justice to
the Athenians it must be said that Romans are not always specialists
upon the Forum, nor Londoners upon the Tower. She found, however,
a local doctor to conduct her round the town: he told her that he
belonged to the family of Perikles. Those of us who have travelled in
Greece have been introduced to other descendants of the great Athenian
statesman. The Swedish lady liked Athens. “The town,” she wrote,
“is better than any of the others. There are some very pretty houses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
Greek as well as Turkish.” She remarked upon the hospitality of the
Greeks, who regaled her mistress in their homes upon orangeade,
lemonade, fresh almonds, pomegranates, and jams, just as their descendants
do still. Our Hessian officer, too, liked the Athenians; “they
are very respectable, good people,” he wrote, “only one cannot understand
them, because they speak Greek.” The English consul, however,
the same Frenchman, Giraud, who had acted as <i>cicerone</i> to Spon, spoke
German and Italian, as well as Greek and Turkish, and hobbled about
with the distinguished Swedes<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>. Despite his trouble in his feet, he seems
to have been still an active man, who sent two dispatches on the
Venetian conquest to his ambassador at Constantinople before his
French colleague had written a word about it. A Protestant from Lyons,
but married to a daughter of the Athenian Palaiologoi, he was closely
connected with the town.</p>

<p>Morosini had converted into churches the mosques of every place
that he had taken. At Athens he turned two mosques into Catholic
churches, in addition to the already existing chapel of the Capuchins,
and made his naval chaplain, D. Lorenzo Papaplis, priest of the church
of Dionysios the Areopagite<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>. For the use of his Lutheran auxiliaries
he founded out of another mosque, that “of the Column,” near the
bazaar, the first Protestant place of worship in Greece, which was
inaugurated under the name of Holy Trinity on October 19 with a
sermon by the minister Beithmann. While to the Venetian commander
non-Catholics thus owe the introduction of their liturgy into Hellas, to
his conquest of Athens military history is indebted for two views of
the Akropolis and a general view of Athens at the moment of the
explosion in the Parthenon, all sketched by the Venetian engineer,
Verneda, another unofficial view of Athens, a plan of the Akropolis also
by Verneda, and a plan of the town designed by him under the direction
of Count di San Felice<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>. This last work has been called “the first serious
plan of the town of Athens,” but its object was military rather than
archæological—to explain to the council of war and the home government
the extent and cost of the works necessary for the defence of
Athens.</p>

<p>Whether Athens could be defended, that was the question which its
conquerors now had to decide. At a council of war, held at the Piræus
on December 31, it was pointed out that it was impossible for the small
Venetian forces to fortify the town, or even to leave a garrison there to
defend its inhabitants, for all the available troops would be needed for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
the attack upon Negroponte in the spring; while, even if it could be
fortified, Athens, situated so far from the sea, could not be revictualled
while the Turks were still about. The destruction of Athens was actually
mooted, but the council decided to postpone that for the present, and
to remove the Greek population, estimated at over 6000, besides the
Albanians, into the Morea and grant to them lands in the new Venetian
territory there as compensation for the loss of their old homes. A further
council, held on January 2, 1688, decided, in view of the spread of the
plague from the Morea to continental Greece and some of the islands,
to accelerate the departure of the Athenians, so as to remove the army,
and in the meanwhile to organise a sanitary administration of the town.
The decision to remove the Athenians filled them with dismay; the
“elders,” the <i>vecchiardi</i>, as they were styled in Italian, in vain offered
to contribute 20,000 reals and to maintain the garrison at their own cost,
if they were allowed to remain and men were left to defend “the castle<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>.”
The plague and Turkish raids continued to harass the Venetians and the
auxiliaries, while those mutual recriminations, usual among allies of
various nationalities, so greatly disturbed the harmony of the expeditionary
force that Morosini formed five companies of Albanians,
who might enable him to dispense with his grumbling German troops.
Koenigsmark on January 30 made another proposition—to leave a
garrison of 300 men on the Akropolis with provisions for sixteen months,
but Morosini calculated that this would involve the presence of another
hundred servants, and that for all this force a large quantity of biscuit
and wine would be needed. But the argument which weighed most with
the decisive council of February 12 was the water-supply. The sixteen
cisterns of the Akropolis, it was said, held water for only three months,
and of these the great cistern under the Parthenon had probably been
damaged by the explosion, and the still larger one in the theatre of
Dionysos could easily be cut off, and the water-supply of “the castle”
thereby reduced to what would suffice for only fifty days. It was,
therefore, unanimously decided to leave “the castle” of Athens for the
present as it was, with its walls intact, but to remove all the guns and
munitions, trusting to Providence for its ultimate re-capture. The
council justified its resolve to abandon the place by stating that the
only object of attacking Athens had been to push back the enemy from
the neighbourhood of the isthmus of Corinth.</p>

<p>Morosini determined, however, to carry off to Venice some memorial
of Athens which could vie with the four bronze horses, carried thither
after the capture of Constantinople. He ordered the removal from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
western pediment of the Parthenon of the statue of Poseidon (whom
Morosini thought to be Zeus) and the chariot of Victory (whom the
Venetians mistook for Athena); but the recent explosion had disarranged
the blocks of marble, so that the workmen no sooner touched
them than these beautiful sculptures fell in pieces upon the ground.
Morosini, coolly announcing this disaster in a dispatch to the senate,
expressed satisfaction that none of the workmen had been injured, and
announced his decision to carry off instead a marble lioness without a
head; but the head, as he added in a sentence worthy of Mummius, “can
be perfectly replaced by another piece.” His secretary, San Gallo,
took away, however, the Victory’s head, which Laborde purchased in
1840 from a Venetian antiquary, while other fragments were picked up
from the ruins by other Venetian, Danish and Hessian officers. Morosini
did not content himself with the headless lioness alone; he carried off
the great lion, which had given to the Piræus its mediæval name, and
a third lion which had stood near the temple of Theseus, where it was
seen by Babin and Spon; a fourth, a lioness, which bears the inscription
<i>Anno Corcuræ liberatæ</i>, did not reach Venice till 1716, the year of
Schulenburg’s deliverance of Corfù, and, therefore, does not figure in
Fanelli’s<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> previous plate of the lions before the arsenal, where they may
still be seen. This done, the Venetian forces abandoned Athens on April 4
and five days later the last detachment set sail for Poros. The nett
result of the Venetian capture of Athens had been disastrous. It had
done irreparable damage to the Parthenon without any permanent
military or political gain; it had injured the inhabitants, who had been
forced to leave their homes; it had spread disease and discontent among
the allies. To set against these disadvantages Venice acquired four marble
lions and Morosini the fame of having temporarily held the famous
city. To us Verneda’s plans are the only satisfactory result of its siege.</p>

<p>It remains to describe the fate of the exiled Athenians and of the
conquerors of Athens. The unhappy natives had left on March 24, and
some even earlier. Three boat-loads went to the Venetian island of
Zante, others to the Venetian possessions in the Morea, especially to
Nauplia, but most (under the leadership of the brothers Gaspari) to
Ægina and, like their ancestors at the time of the Persian invasion,
to Salamis (“Culuris,” as it was still called), where, as the famous
<i>Fragments</i> from the monastery of the Anargyroi (SS. Cosmas and Damian)
at Athens inform us<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>, they built houses and churches at Ambelaki, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
“Attica remained deserted for about three years” except for a few
stragglers on the Akropolis and in some towers of the town. This is the
passage upon which Fallmerayer based his theory of the desertion of
Athens for nearly 400 years from the time of Justinian! The poorest
went to Corinth, while the leading families were scattered about the
Morea, the Benizeloi at Patras, the Limponai at Koron, Peroules at
Nauplia, and Dousmanes at Gastouni in Elis. The last-named received
for his services to Venice several grants of land and the title of <i>Cavaliere
di San Marco</i>; his family subsequently became counts and migrated to
Corfù, where fifty years ago one of them published an Italian account
of Gladstone’s famous mission. To other Athenian notables, who had
been specially useful to them, the Venetians also gave money or titles—a
pension to the ex-metropolitan Jacob as compensation for his punishment
by the patriarch, the title of count to the schoolmaster, Benaldes,
to another scholarly Athenian, Joannes Macola, the translator of Ovid’s
<i>Metamorphoses</i> and Justin’s <i>History</i>, to Taronites for his subsequent
services at the siege of Nauplia, and to Venizelos Rhoïdes. Indeed, so
well were these Athenian refugees treated, that a geographical shibboleth
was devised to discriminate between the genuine and the pseudo-exiles
from Athens<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>. To the 662 Athenian families which entered the Morea,
the Venetian authorities assigned lands, vineyards, olive-trees, houses,
shops, and gardens in proportion to the supposed requirements of the
four classes into which Athenian society was then divided. An official
Venetian report of 1701 praises their industry in trade, but remarks that
“not even the common folk among them were inclined to work on the
land,” and extols their “subtle intelligence,” adding that they desired
to return to Athens, although the town was once more under Turkish
rule, while at the same time retaining their Moreote property<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>.</p>

<p>Athens was the climax of Morosini’s Greek career. On board his
galley at Poros he received the news of his election as doge, but his first
ducal enterprise, the siege of Negroponte, not only failed, despite the
rising of northern Greece against the Turks, but cost the lives of
Koenigsmark by fever and of Peter Gaspari, leader of the Athenian
volunteers. This was the last big event of the war. The German auxiliaries
left Greece; Morosini, recalled home by fever and the duties of his new
office, left to his successor, Cornaro, the task of completing the conquest
of the Morea by starving out the impregnable rock of Monemvasia in
1690; meanwhile a military revolution at Constantinople had placed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
weak Sultan on the throne and a strong minister, the third of the
Kiuprili dynasty, in power. The latter’s first act was to conciliate the
Christians, and to appoint a Mainate, Liberakes Gerakares, then a
prisoner in the arsenal, as bey of Maina and leader against the Venetians.
The “first Christian prince of Greece” had served as a youth in the
Venetian fleet; he had then turned pirate, and had during the Cretan
war acted as a Turkish instrument in his native land. He now addressed
a proclamation to the Athenian exiles in Salamis and Ægina, bidding
them return to their homes and telling them that he was authorised by
the Sultan to grant them an amnesty, at the same time threatening those
who disobeyed his orders with condign punishment at his hands<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>.
Under these circumstances they thought it best to come to terms with
their former masters. The superstitious among them attributed the
plague, the famine, the drought, and the Turkish raids upon their
vineyards on the continent opposite Salamis, to the curse of the
Œcumenical Patriarch. To him, therefore, they addressed an appeal,
drawn up by the schoolmaster, Argyros Benaldes, describing in high-flown
language their pitiable condition and imploring with deep humility
his forgiveness<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>. The patriarch relented, and, probably owing to his
mediation, the Athenian refugees were allowed, in 1690, to return.
Several of the principal families, however, remained in voluntary exile,
and their property was put up to auction and bought by a group of
leading Athenians; many Athenian Greeks stayed at Nauplia till its
recapture by the Turks in 1715; nor did all the Athenian Turks, who
had gone to Asia Minor, return; in 1705 the town contained only 300
Turkish families. The population was, therefore, smaller and the material
prosperity less than before the Venetian conquest. Great damage had
been done during the “three years” of exile in Salamis; most of the
houses had fallen, the raiders had burned the trees, and to their fires is
attributed the blackening of Hadrian’s Porch. In order to facilitate the
economic recovery of Athens, the Sultan allowed it to be free from taxes
for three years; the fortifications of the Akropolis were repaired, as a
pompous Turkish inscription on the old Turkish entrance, dated 1708,
long testified, while a small mosque (which collapsed in 1842) was
erected within the Parthenon out of the ruins caused by the besiegers’
bomb<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>. Greek education, which had languished at Athens since Benaldes
had been appointed schoolmaster at Nauplia and then at Patras, was
revived by the opening of a school in 1714, while the appointment of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
learned geographer, Meletios, as metropolitan, gave to Athens a patron
of culture. But the reinstated exiles fell to intriguing and quarrelling
among themselves to such a degree over their metropolitan, that the
Patriarch of Jerusalem—for the Holy Sepulchre had many possessions
in Attica during the Turkish period and still possesses property near
the so-called <i>Anaphiótika</i> at Athens—wrote to them, congratulating
them on having so wise and noble a hierarch, and bidding them for the
honour of their famous city cast out scandals from their midst<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>. Meletios
was specially anxious to keep out of a quarrel between his flock and the
representative of the <i>voivode</i>, at that time an absentee, whose exactions
provoked an Athenian deputation to Constantinople in 1712, headed by
Demetrios Palaiologos, a local notable skilled in Turkish—a rare
accomplishment among the Athenian Christians, for most of their
Turkish fellow citizens spoke Greek. The chief of the black eunuchs, to
whom Athens still belonged, not only deposed his <i>voivode</i>, but, taking
from his secretary’s girdle his silver ink-horn, handed it to Palaiologos
with the words, “Take this ink-horn and from to-day I appoint thee
<i>voivode</i> of Athens.” This was the first and last occasion on which a
<i>rayah</i> was made <i>voivode</i> of Athens. The local Turks and the local
Christian notables alike were furious at being governed by a Christian,
and the former assassinated him in the house of his kinsman, Palaiologos
Benizelos<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>.</p>

<p>Monemvasia was the last durable acquisition of Venice during the
war. In 1691 the island fortress of Grabusa, off the north-western
extremity of Crete, was betrayed by two Neapolitan officers in the
Venetian service; next year an attempt to take Canea was frustrated by
the old Venetian fortifications, once erected against the Turks. Liberakes
raided the Morea, but the Moreote Greeks did not rise, as he had led
his Turkish patrons to expect, and the fear of being cut off by the disembarkation
of a Venetian force at the isthmus made the raiders soon
retire. In 1693 Morosini resumed the command, but his only acts were
to re-fortify the castle of Ægina, which he had demolished during the
Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid, as long as the war
lasted, by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero
as governor<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>. This led the Athenians to send him a request for the
renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. His
death at Nauplia in 1694 caused the appointment of Zeno, then governor
of the Morea, as his successor. Zeno easily accomplished the capture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
of the rich island of Chios, but in the following year the island was
abandoned. The Greek population was more favourable to the Moslems
than to the Catholic Venetians, especially as the presence of the
Archbishop of Naxos on board the fleet was interpreted as an intention
to interfere with the Orthodox Church. Those Catholic Chiotes, on the
other hand, who did not emigrate to the Morea, were dismayed at the
departure of the Italians, and paid dearly for their brief triumph when
the Turks returned. Four were hanged, their religion was prohibited,
and their cathedral (whose Archbishop was compensated by the
Venetians with the titular see of Corinth) turned into a mosque<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>. This
was the last important event of the war in Greece. A series of naval
battles was fought in the Ægean; and, even after the Venetians had
abandoned the idea of operations north of the Morea, the continental
Greeks kept up a guerilla warfare on their own account with the aid
of Slavonian troops. Unable to make head against their combined
efforts, Liberakes went over to the Venetians, who showed their distrust
of the “Bey of Maina” by imprisoning him at Brescia, where he ended
his days. In 1699, thanks to English mediation, the war ended with
the peace of Carlovitz, by which Venice retained possession of the Morea,
Santa Maura, and Ægina, and ceased to pay tribute for Zante, but
restored to the Sultan her continental Greek conquests, such as Lepanto.
The castles of Prevesa and Rumeli, the classic Antirrhion, were to be
demolished, but Venice did not recover Grabusa. Thus the end of this
fifteen years’ costly war found her with a Greek dominion consisting of
the seven Ionian Islands, Butrinto and Parga in Epeiros, the two Cretan
forts of Spinalonga and Suda, Tenos and Ægina, and the “kingdom” of
the Morea, the whole of which, in the Middle Ages, had never been hers.</p>

<p>When the Venetians set to work to re-organise the Morea, they
found their new conquest devastated and depopulated<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>. Much of the
land had gone out of cultivation, for there were not hands enough to
till it, and the war and the plague had aggravated the evils engendered
by the long period of Turkish rule. As early as 1687 they took the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
step to improve the condition of their new colony by sending three
commissioners with instructions to make a survey of the country, its
mills, fisheries, mines and other resources, and in 1688 sent Cornaro
as its first governor, or <i>provveditore generale</i>. He estimated the total
population, exclusive of Maina and the district of Corinth, to be only
86,468, as against 200,000, exclusive of garrisons and foreigners, before
the war; Michiel, one of the three commissioners, puts it, without Maina,
at 97,118, of whom 3577 were Turks converted to Christianity from
interested motives, who required careful watching. Out of 2111
villages the war and the plague had laid desolate 656, and Cornaro could
not find a living soul between Patras and Kalavryta. Under the
Venetian rule the population gradually rose to more than it had been
in the Turkish time—to 116,000 in 1692, to 176,844 in 1701, to over
250,000 in 1708. These figures were probably below the mark, owing to
the characteristically oriental dislike of the natives to be numbered—a
proceeding regarded as the prelude to that accurate taxation which
has never been popular in the Near East. The increase was partly due
to emigration from the neighbouring Turkish provinces and the Ionian
Islands. Besides the Athenians, mostly congregated at Nauplia, there
were the Chiote exiles at Modon, Thebans and Lepantines (after the
peace), Cretans from Canea and even Bulgarians. Cornaro alone in his
two years of office was successful in inducing 6000 emigrants to enter
the Morea, where he gave them lands between Patras and Aigion and at
Kalavryta, and promised them exemption from taxes. Ere long there
was no one in the Morea who had not his house, his mill, and his bit
of land—a thing very rare among the Christians of Turkey—and even
the Athenians, the flower of the emigrants, were admittedly much better
off than they had been at home. Only material welfare does not satisfy
the whole nature of man, else <i>ubi bene, ibi patria</i> would have been an
easy solution of many Balkan questions.</p>

<p>The population during the Venetian occupation was mixed. The
majority was, of course, overwhelmingly Greek, but there was considerable
difference between the Greeks of the various districts, as in
classical times. The Moreotes did not like “foreigners,” in which
designation, like the modern Italian peasants, they included people of
their own race from other parts of Greece. The natives of Elis were
specially hostile to “strangers,” whereas their neighbours in Achaia,
from their commerce with the Ionian Islands, tolerated “foreigners.”
The Venetians did not give the Moreotes in general a very good character,
but the faults which they attributed to them were not due to a double
dose of original sin, but to the effects of long years of Turkish rule. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
are described in the Venetian reports as suspicious, lazy, and inclined
to speak evil of each other. Suspicion is a common quality of southern
nations, and laziness was excusable under the Turkish system, when the
industrious man was punished by being heavily mulcted in the fruits
of his industry. With the Turkish dress the Greeks retained the Turkish
maxims, but it was noticed that the women of Monemvasia had preserved
from the previous Venetian occupation the old Venetian dress. The
Arkadians were “rustics and truly Arkadian, but full of wiles,” and
there was considerable polish at Kalamata. The Cretans were an
exception; brought up under Venetian rule for centuries, they were
very industrious. The Ionians were restless, but more cultured than the
Moreotes, of whom the most civilised were the townsfolk of Mistra, who
“dressed and lived with more splendour than the others, boasting to
be the remnant of the true Spartan blood.” All the people of the country
round Mistra were pure Greeks, but the town contained over 400 Jews,
whose descendants Chateaubriand<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> found there in 1806, and whose
compatriots’ funeral inscriptions I noticed in the museum there. The
Jewish element in the Morea was, however, small—it was a poor country—and
the only other Hebrew colonies were at Nauplia and Patras.
Truth was not the strong point of the Naupliotes, but they were loyal
to Venice, as were from the first the Mainates, who abhorred the very
name of the Turks, of whom the other Greeks stood in awe, but had a
rooted objection to paying taxes, always went armed, and “professed
to observe still the institutes of Lycurgus,” of which the chief was
apparently the blood-feud. Besides the Greeks and the Jews, both
chiefly occupied with trade, there were the Albanians, mostly agriculturists
and specially numerous in the province of Romania, men of fine
physique but hating war. Indeed, with the exception of the Mainates
and some of the emigrants from Northern Greece, the population was
essentially pacific and relied upon its foreign rulers to defend it. It was,
however, litigious, and this natural tendency was increased by a
“hungry crowd of small lawyers, partly from the Ionian Islands, partly
from the Venetian bar,” who became the curse of the Morea.</p>

<p>The Venetians divided the peninsula at first into six provinces and
seven fiscal boards, but the number of the provinces was reduced to
four, viz. Romania (capital Nauplia), Lakonia (capital Monemvasia),
Messenia (capital Navarino Nuovo), and Achaia (capital Patras). Each
province had a <i>provveditore</i> for its administration and defence, a judicial
official known as <i>rettore</i>, and a treasurer, or <i>camerlengo</i>. There were also
<i>provveditori</i> in seven places which were not provincial capitals, viz.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
Mistra, Kalavryta, Phanari, Gastouni, Koron, Modon and Zarnata.
Above them all stood the <i>provveditore generale</i>. None of these officials,
as we see from Hopf’s lists<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>, held office for more than two or three years,
according to the usual Venetian system; but they were not new to the
task of governing Greeks. The government was, therefore, experienced,
but still wholly in foreign hands, although Morosini allowed a few
communities to manage their local affairs, and Maina enjoyed practical
independence. This liberal concession was not, however, altogether
successful. “Every castle, almost every village, aspired to erect itself
into a republic,” wrote one of the governors-general, and these petty
communes begged Venice to send them a Venetian noble, in order that
they might pose as the equals of the provincial capitals, even offering
to pay his salary for the advantage conferred by his presence. Moreover,
persons suddenly promoted from the status of Turkish <i>rayah</i> to be local
magnates, were not always disposed to treat the Greek peasants upon
democratic principles, but rather upon those by which they had been
treated themselves. An emancipated slave is apt to be a slave-driver.</p>

<p>One important privilege was granted to the communities from
political motives—the election of the Orthodox bishops. Of all the
difficulties, which Venice had to face, the greatest was the Œcumenical
Patriarch, an official, who, being resident in the Turkish capital, was
perforce a Turkish agent, and who, before this reform, had named the
nineteen Moreote bishops and the abbots of the <i>stavropégia</i>—monasteries
directly dependent upon him. These, in 1701, formed 26 out of the total
of 158 (with 1367 monks). The Patriarch’s patronage had, therefore,
been considerable, and his influence, even apart from Turkish pressure,
was unlikely to be used in favour of a Catholic government. But this
was not his only loss. Before the Venetian conquest, one-half of the
Epiphany and Easter offerings of the priests and people—3 reals for
every priest in the diocese and ¼ real for every household—had gone to
the bishop, and one-half to the Patriarch. Morosini reduced these
offerings, the <i>philótimo</i> as it was called, by about one-half, at the same
time ordering that the whole of it should be given to the local bishop and
nothing to the Patriarch. The Patriarch, thus injured in both his powers
and his purse, threatened to excommunicate such communes as elected
their own bishops. To this the Venetian governor-general, Grimani,
retorted by forbidding the entry of the patriarchal exarch into the
Morea; but his duties, mainly those of a tax-collector, were quietly
undertaken by the Metropolitan of Patras, while the Patriarch became
as anxious as the Turks to turn the Venetians out of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
Unfortunately, these disadvantages of a well-meant reform were not
accompanied by corresponding benefits. Simony continued to be rife,
and unsuitable persons were often chosen as bishops by the communities.
Nor was the Patriarch the only external influence over the
Moreote church, for there were some twenty-four <i>metóchia</i>, or “monastic
farms” belonging to monasteries in Turkish territory, which not only
sent money out of the country to swell the enemy’s revenues, but were
centres of political propaganda and smuggling. These difficulties were
not peculiar to the Venetians: they likewise faced the Bavarian regency.
The Venetian official reports show a consciousness of the policy of
conciliation towards the church of the vast mass of the people. For the
Catholics, outside the Venetian garrison, were few, except at Nauplia
and among the Chiote exiles at Modon. Indeed, the former Archbishop
of Chios was the first Catholic Archbishop of the Venetian Morea; and
his successor, Mgr. Carlini, whose see was Corinth but who resided at
Nauplia, was the only Catholic prelate in the whole kingdom; even as
late as 1714 the Morea contained only one Catholic bishop. We find,
however, the Greeks sending their children to the friars’ school to learn
Italian and the rudiments of Latin, and there was a scheme for founding
a college at Tripolitsa. Unfortunately the ministers of religion, as
Cornaro epigrammatically wrote, seemed sometimes to be sent to the
Morea “rather as a punishment for their own sins than to correct the
sins of others.”</p>

<p>Materially, the Venetian administration marked an advance, as the
foreign occupation of Turkish territory always does, but trade was
handicapped by the selfish colonial policy of Venice. Upon the Morea,
“a poor country without industries or manufacture,” the Turks had
imposed thirteen taxes, of which five (the <i>haratch</i>, a further local
capitation-tax, called <i>spenza</i>, the duty on horses’ shoes, the tax on
absentee landlords, and the burden of providing and transporting food
for the army at half price) fell upon the Christians alone, while the others
(such as the tithe and the taxes on animals) were common to both them
and the Turks. Thus, out of a total of 1,699,000 reals, the Christians
paid 1,350,300, besides what was illegally extorted from them. The
Venetians raised their revenue from tithes of all agricultural produce,
taxes on wine, spirits, oil and tobacco, the usual Italian system of a salt
monopoly, customs dues, and the Crown lands. Careful management
and increased prosperity increased the revenue, only 280,000 reals in
1689, to 500,501 in 1711. The farming of the tithes was entrusted to the
communes, but the Mainates refused to pay tithes, consenting, however,
to pay, although reluctantly, a fixed tribute called <i>mactù</i>. The salt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
monopoly was a hardship, because, although the price was low, a
peasant living near the chief salt-pans at Thermisi was not allowed to
buy his salt on the spot, but had to make a long journey to some distant
magazine. Agriculture improved after the peace of Carlovitz and the
fortification of Nauplia, when it became clear that Venice intended to
stay and security of tenure was thus assured. But the customs dues
yielded little, because the Republic forbade the creation of industries
likely to compete with those of Venice, and compelled the Moreotes to
send every article to that city. English merchants, therefore, found it
cheaper to trade with Turkey, and the governors-general in vain pointed
out the folly of this commercial policy, which caused the decline of such
industries as that of silk at Mistra, until it was revived by the Chiote
exiles at Modon. As the foreign garrison could not stomach the resinous
wine, and began to import foreign vintages, efforts were made to extend
and improve the local vineyards. The currant, which is now successfully
cultivated along the Moreote shore of the Corinthian Gulf, had, indeed,
been known in the peninsula as far back as the fourteenth century, when
it is mentioned by Pegalotti<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>; but it was not till after the Turkish reconquest
that it was grown and exported in large quantities for the
consumption of northern races. Even with these drawbacks, however,
and the burden of having to contribute to the maintenance of Cerigo
and Ægina, both united administratively with the Morea since the peace,
the peninsula not only paid all the expenses of administration but
furnished a substantial balance to the naval defence of the Republic,
in which it was directly interested. Land defence was a more difficult
question. Of the natives only the Mainates wanted to be soldiers, nor
could the Greeks be trusted with arms, while French consuls, anxious
to weaken Venice, encouraged French mercenaries, as at Suda and
Spinalonga<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>, to desert her service.</p>

<p>The fact was that, like Great Britain in the Ionian Islands and Cyprus,
and Austria-Hungary in Bosnia and the Herzegovina, Venice had
improved the administration, without winning the love of her alien
subjects. Foreign domination, even under the most favourable circumstances,
never succeeds in satisfying the Balkan races, whose
national feelings are keenly developed. The Venetian governors, as their
reports show, were well-meaning men, but they were aliens in race and
religion to the governed. Even had their administration been perfect,
that fact alone would have rendered it unpopular after the first feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
of relief at the expulsion of the Turkish yoke was over. Liberated
peoples, especially in the Near East, expect much from their western
administrators, while, as we know in Egypt, the evils of the old corrupt
rule are soon forgotten. It was so in the Morea. Thus, in 1710, the
French traveller, De La Motraye<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>, found the Greeks of Modon “praying
for their return under Turkish domination, and envying the lot of those
Greeks who still lived under it.” This was partly due to the lightness of
the Turkish capitation-tax, and they added: “Venetian soldiers are
quartered on us, their officers debauch our wives and daughters, their
priests speak against our religion and constantly urge us to embrace
theirs, which the Turks never did.” Besides, the Greeks had a feeling,
justified by the result, that Turkey was stronger than Venice, and therefore
desired to be on the winning side, and thus avoid reprisals. Even
the rough-and-ready Turkish justice, which was administered with the
stick, seemed to one Venetian governor to be more suited to the people
than the interminable Venetian procedure, presided over by ignorant
young nobles, assisted by venal clerks. Thus the poor suitor fared badly,
for the governor-general could not be ubiquitous. Public safety,
however, improved; as the local policeman was often a brigand, a local
militia was organised by the communes, and a notoriously dangerous
pass, like that of Makryplagi, through which the railway now descends
to Kalamata, was guarded by the men of the neighbouring villages, who
were authorised to levy a small toll from the travellers. Crime diminished,
and it rarely became necessary to apply the penalty of death. With the
Mainates, in particular, mildness and diplomacy were the only possible
methods. Luxury, however, and moral depravation crept into Nauplia,
the Venetian capital of the Morea, and the historian, Diedo<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>, wrote that
“in magnificence and pomp it had no cause to envy the most cultured
capitals.” Sternly practical people, the Venetians did nothing for the
classical antiquities of the Peloponnese; indeed, Grimani turned the
amphitheatre of Corinth into a lazaretto; but the Venetian occupation
spread abroad the names of the classic sites, and the various illustrated
books upon the Morea and other parts of Greece, which were rapidly
turned out from Coronelli’s “workshop,” were at once the result and
the cause of the popular curiosity about this once famous land, which
had emerged, thanks to Morosini’s victories, from Turkish darkness into
the light of day.</p>

<p>As early as 1711 the Venetian government had been warned that
Turkey was eager to recover the Morea, the loss of which was severely
felt; yet no preparations were made to meet the coming storm, but most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
of the fortresses were left in a bad condition. Nothing had been done
since 1696 to protect the isthmus, and Palamedi at Nauplia alone had
been fortified at immense cost with those splendid works which still
remain, with an occasional abandoned cannon of 1685 on the “Fig Fort,”
a memorial of the Venetian occupation. Each of its bulwarks bore the
name of a famous Venetian—Morosini, Sagredo and Grimani—and an
inscription over the gate contains the date—1712—of its completion<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>.
There were not, however, sufficient men to defend it; indeed, when war
was declared the total army in the Morea consisted of only 10,735 men,
while the fleet consisted of only eleven galleys and eight armed ships.
In 1714, after having defeated Russia and renewed their treaty with
Poland, the Turks had their hands free to attack the enemy, against
whom their own desire for revenge and French commercial jealousy
urged them. The moment seemed favourable, with Russia not yet
recovered from her late Turkish war and pledged not to make an alliance
with Venice, with the Moreote Greeks “desirous to return” (so the war-party
argued) “to their old obedience.” Both sides could rely, it was
true, on spiritual help; but the support of Pope Clement XI was less
valuable than the threat of the Œcumenical Patriarch to excommunicate
all Greeks who fought for the schismatic Republic, which had curtailed
his revenues and privileges. An excuse for war was easily found: Venice,
it was pretended, had supplied the Montenegrins with arms and money
and received their bishop, Danilo I, at Cattaro. In vain the Republic
hoped for the Emperor’s mediation, and hastily sent munitions and
provisions to the Morea. It was decided to abandon all places except
Nauplia, Argos, Monemvasia, Modon, Koron, Kielefa, Zarnata, and the
castle of the Morea—the corresponding castle on the opposite side of
the Corinthian Gulf had been re-fortified by Turkey in defiance of the
treaty of Carlovitz—and to demolish both Navarinos. It was, however,
too late.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1715 was an unbroken series of striking successes
for the Turkish army of over 100,000 men and the large fleet. The first
blow was the loss of Tenos, a Venetian colony since 1390, whose cowardly
commander, Balbi, capitulated at the first summons of the Turkish
admiral, subsequently expiating his conduct by imprisonment for life.
Its naturally strong fortress of San Nicolo, which Tournefort<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> fifteen
years before had found garrisoned by “fourteen ragged soldiers, of whom
seven were French deserters,” contained abundant food and ammunition;
the Teniotes, so predominantly Catholics, that the place was called
“the Pope’s island,” were loyal to Venice and formed an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
militia, which had repulsed the Turkish admiral, Mezzomorto, in the
late war; and this solitary Venetian island had been regarded as “a
thorn in the centre of the Turkish empire.” The Turkish army, under
Ali Kamurgi, aided by many Greek militia-men from the northern shores
of the gulf, crossed the isthmus and besieged Corinth. Minotto, who
“held in Corinth’s towers the Doge’s delegated powers,” resisted a five
days’ bombardment, although the Greek non-combatants desired to
save their property by surrender, before he capitulated on condition
that the garrison was transported to Corfù. But an explosion in the
fortress, ascribed by Byron in <i>The Siege of Corinth</i> to Minotto himself,
but perhaps due to accident, led the Janissaries to massacre the Venetians
and Greeks. Minotto was carried off as a slave to Smyrna, where he
was ransomed by the wife of the Dutch consul<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>; the Greek prisoners
were sold “like cattle.” This frightened the Moreotes into submission
and encouraged the Æginetans to invoke the aid of the Turkish admiral,
to whom the commander, Bembo, surrendered the island without
resistance. The fact that the Turkish general paid for provisions, while
the Venetians had commandeered them, enlisted the interests, and
therefore the sympathies, of the Moreote peasantry, and excited the
surprise of the French interpreter, Brue, who has left a diary of his
experiences in this campaign. Nauplia was the next objective of the
invaders. The poet Manthos of Joannina, who was there when it fell,
expressed the current belief of the Greeks (of whom, however, few could
be induced even by high pay, to aid in the defence) that the strongly
fortified capital of the Venetian Morea was betrayed by De La Salle
(or Sala), a French officer in the Venetian service, who had sent the
plans of Palamedi to Negroponte. Over a century later the traitor’s
ruined house was pointed out to Emerson, the historian<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>. It had been
pulled down and an “anathema” of stones raised on the site, upon
which no one dared to build till 1859; it was called “Sala’s threshing-floor”
and used for drying clothes. After a brief resistance Palamedi,
on which so much had been spent, was stormed, and the storming-party
thence entered the town. The captors showed special fury against the
Catholics, whose Archbishop, Carlini, was among the slain. The capture
of Nauplia so greatly delighted Ahmed III, that he came to see the place,
visiting Athens on his way—the first and last time that a Sultan set
foot there since Mohammed II—and, according to a legend, presenting
the gardens of Phaleron to his body-guard<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>. The garrisons of Modon and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
the castle of the Morea mutinied, and refused to defend those fortresses;
worse still was the “ignominious surrender” of the strong and well-provisioned
rock of Monemvasia by its boastful governor, Badoer,
without firing a shot, at the first summons of the Turkish admiral, who
subsequently admitted that he could not have taken it. Meanwhile the
Venetian fleet remained inactive off Sapienza, because, as its admiral
pleaded, he did not wish to add a defeat on sea to that on land! The
Morea was now lost; even Maina submitted. But the commanders of
the two surviving Cretan forts of Suda and Spinalonga were resolute men.
Under the circumstances—for Suda’s defences were judged defective,
and the French consul at Canea aided the Turkish admiral with his
advice and local knowledge<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>—the small garrison did well to hold out
till September 25, when it honourably capitulated. Spinalonga then
surrendered without a siege, and the last fragment of Venetian rule in
Crete was gone. The Sultan was as much pleased at the taking of these
two places as at the reconquest of the Morea. Cerigo and Cerigotto next
hoisted the white flag, and Venice was so much alarmed for the safety
of Corfù, that she blew up the recent fortifications of Santa Maura and
temporarily abandoned that island. The Turks occupied Butrinto and
threatened Corfù; but the bravery of Schulenburg defended the latter
and recovered the former and Santa Maura in 1716, and took Prevesa
and Vonitza in 1717. An alliance with the Emperor, alarmed at the
effect of the Turkish successes upon his Hungarian subjects, saved
Venice from further losses; Great Britain offered her mediation, and
the peace of Passarovitz in 1718 gave her back Cerigo and Cerigotto, and
allowed her to keep Butrinto, Santa Maura, Prevesa and Vonitza. The
nett result of the two wars, in which she had kept and lost the Morea,
was that, as against the loss of Tenos and the three Cretan forts, which
she held in 1684, she had to set off the possession of Santa Maura and
the two places on the Ambrakian gulf in 1718. She had “consolidated”
her Levantine dominion: Cerigo was now her farthest possession. But
in her case, as in that of Turkey in our own time, “consolidation”
meant decline. From that date she ceased to count as a factor in Greek
affairs, except in the Ionian Islands and their continental dependencies.</p>

<p>The collapse of her power in the Morea in a hundred and one days
proved that Venice was unable to defend the Greeks, whom she had
never won over to her rule. But, although she had not gained their love,
her administration had not been without some lasting benefits to them.
The example of Venice, despite the venality of her judges, forced the
Turks to treat their Greek subjects better, and agriculture and wine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
growing were improved. The Venetian occupation of the Morea had the
same effect upon the Greeks as the twenty-one years’ Austrian occupation
of Serbia from 1718 to 1739 upon the Serbs; it spread a higher
degree of material civilisation. But even the most benevolent and most
efficient government by foreigners—and a modern Greek historian has
attributed both good intentions and efficiency to the Venetians—is
bound to fail when national consciousness begins to awaken. After the
Venetians went, the Greeks prepared to fight, not to substitute the rule
of one foreign power for that of another but for independence, not for
Venice, or Turkey, or Russia, but for Greece. The younger generations,
which had grown up under Venetian auspices, were manlier and better
than those which had only known Turkish rule. If Venice contributed
thereby to preparing the way for the war of independence, it was her
greatest service to the Greeks.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="heading22">1. VALONA</h3>

<p>The late Italian occupation of Valona has drawn attention to what
has been called one of the two keys of the Adriatic. It may,
therefore, be of interest to trace the history of this important strategic
position, which has been held by no less than twelve different masters.</p>

<p>The name αὐλών, “a hollow between hills,” was applied to various
places in antiquity, and from the accusative of this word comes the
Italian form “Valona,” or, as the Venetians often wrote it, “Avalona.”
In antiquity there were, however, few allusions to this particular αὐλών,
the probable date of its foundation being, therefore, fairly late, although
the pitch-mine of Selenitza, three hours to the east, was worked by the
Romans in the time of Ovid<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>, and Pliny the Elder<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> knew the now famous
island of Saseno, to which both Lucan<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> and Silius Italicus<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> allude, as
a pirate resort. But there is no mention of Valona till the second half
of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, when Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> describes it as “a city and
harbour.” It subsequently occurs several times in the Antonine,
Maritime and Jerusalem Itineraries<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>, and in the Synekdemos of
Hierokles<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>; whereas Kanina, the little town on the hill above it, which
may have been its akropolis, was “built,” according to Leake<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>, “upon
a Hellenic site,” and identified by Pouqueville<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> with Œneus, the fortress
taken by Perseus during the third Macedonian war, and probably
destroyed by Æmilius Paullus, which would thus explain its long disappearance
from history.</p>

<p>Despite the importance of its position as a port of transit between
Rome and Constantinople, Valona is rarely named even by Byzantine
historians before the eleventh century. Bishops of Valona, who were
at different times suffragans of Durazzo or Ochrida, are mentioned in
458, in 553, and in 519, when the legates sent by Pope Hormisdas to
Constantinople were received by the then occupant of the See<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>. It was
there that Peter, Justinian’s envoy, met those of Theodatus, the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
Roman Senators, Liberius and Opilio, and learnt what had befallen
Amalasuntha, the prisoner of Bolsena<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>. Constantine Porphyrogenitus<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>
merely enumerates it as one of the cities comprised in the Theme of
Dyrrachium. Possibly it was one of the Byzantine harbours between
Corfù and the Drin, which escaped temporary absorption in the
Bulgarian Empire of Symeon (<i>c.</i> 917). But Kanina was included in that
of the other great Bulgarian Tsar Samuel (976-1014), until Basil II,
“the Bulgar-slayer,” overthrew that powerful monarch<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>, and it is,
therefore, probable that Valona too was for a brief space a Bulgarian
port. The Sicilian expeditions against Greece in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries naturally brought Valona into prominence as a landing-place
for troops. Anna Comnena<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> frequently mentions it. Thus, in 1081,
Bohemund, son of Robert Guiscard, took and burnt Kanina, Valona,
and Jericho, as the ancient harbour of Eurychos (the Porto Raguseo
of the Italians) was then called; Robert was nearly shipwrecked in a
storm off Cape Glossa, and later on spent two months in the haven of
Jericho. When he left Albania in 1082 he bestowed Valona upon
Bohemund, and when he made his second and fatal expedition in 1084
it was to Valona that he crossed from Otranto. Trade privileges at
Valona (renewed by subsequent Emperors in 1126, 1148 and 1187)
formed part of the price which the Emperor Alexios I paid for the
assistance of the Venetian fleet in this contest<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>. It was there that the
Greek Admiral Kontostephanos watched for Bohemund’s return, and
shortly afterwards we find Michael Kekaumenos, Imperial governor of
Valona, Jericho and Kanina. In 1149, after the capture of Corfù,
Manuel II went to Valona, and encamped there several days before
sailing for Sicily to punish King Roger for his attack upon Greece. He
landed on the islet of Aeironesion (identified by Pouqueville and
Professor Lampros with Saseno); but storms prevented his “punitive
expedition,” so he left Valona by land for Pelagonia<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>.</p>

<p>The fourth crusade, which led to the dismemberment of the Greek
Empire, consequently affected the Adriatic coast. The partition treaty
of 1204 assigned to Venice the province of Durazzo, which included
Valona, as well as Albania, and in the following year the Venetian
<i>podestà</i> at Constantinople formally transferred these possessions to the
Republic, which sent Marino Valaresso with the title of “Duke” to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
govern Durazzo. But meanwhile Michael I Angelos had established in
western Greece the independent Hellenic principality known as the
Despotat of Epeiros, which included both “Old” and “New” Epeiros
(in the latter of which was Valona), extending from Naupaktos to
Durazzo, and which he agreed in 1210 to hold as a nominal fief of Venice,
from the river Shkumbi, south of Durazzo, to Naupaktos, paying a
yearly rent, and promising to grant to the Venetian merchants a special
quarter in every town of his dominions, freedom from taxes, and
assistance in case of need against the Albanians<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>. Thus Valona for fifty-three
years formed an integral part of the Greek Despotat of Epeiros.</p>

<p>The mutual rivalry of the two Greek states which had arisen out
of the ruins of the Byzantine Empire—the Empire of Nicæa and the
Despotat of Epeiros—suggested to the ill-fated Manfred of Sicily that
he might recover the ephemeral conquests of the Sicilian Normans on
the eastern shores of the Adriatic. In 1257, while Michael II of Epeiros
was at war with the Nicene troops, he occupied Valona, Durazzo, Berat,
the Spinarza hills (near the mouth of the Vojussa, or perhaps Svernetsi
on the lagoon of Valona), and their appurtenances; and Michael, desirous
of securing Manfred as an ally against his Greek rival, made a virtue
of necessity by conferring these places together with the hand of his
daughter Helen upon the King of Sicily on the occasion of their marriage<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>
in 1259. Manfred wisely appointed as governor of his trans-Adriatic
possessions a man with experience of the East, Filippo Chinardo, a
Cypriote Frank, and his High Admiral. Indeed, when Manfred fell in
battle at Benevento, fighting against Charles I of Anjou, in 1266,
Chinardo, who married Michael II’s sister-in-law and received Kanina
as her dowry, continued to hold his late master’s Epeirote dominions,
but later in the same year was assassinated at the instigation of the
crafty Despot<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>. The latter had doubtless hoped, now that his son-in-law
was no more, to re-occupy the places which had been his daughter’s and
his sister-in-law’s dowries. But a new claimant now appeared upon the
scene. The fugitive Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II, by
the treaty of Viterbo in 1267 ceded to Charles I of Anjou “all the land
which the Despot Michael gave, handed over and conceded as dowry
or by whatsoever title to his daughter Helen, widow of the late Manfred,
formerly Prince of Taranto, and which the said Manfred and the late
Filippo Chinardo (who acted as Admiral of the said realm) held during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
their lives<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>.” The Sicilian garrisons of Valona, Kanina and Berat held
out, however, against both Michael II and Charles I, the latter of whom
was for some years too much occupied with Italian affairs to intervene
actively beyond the Adriatic. Accordingly, a devoted follower of
Chinardo, Giacomo di Balsignano (near Bari), remained independent
as castellan of Valona; but in 1269 Charles, having made this man’s
brother a prisoner in Italy, declined to release him at the request of
Prince William of Achaia, unless Valona were surrendered. Although
he actually named one of his own supporters to take Balsignano’s place,
that officer held out at Valona for four years more, when he handed over
Valona, but was at once re-appointed castellan of both Valona and
Kanina by Charles. Thus, in 1273, began the effective rule of the
Angevins over Valona. In the following year, the Italian castellan
received fiefs in Southern Italy in exchange for Valona and Kanina, and
a Frenchman, Henri de Courcelles, was appointed in his stead<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>. Chinardo’s
heirs, who had at first been allowed to live on at Valona, were imprisoned
at Trani.</p>

<p>The Angevins attached considerable importance to Valona, especially
from a military point of view. Frequent mention is made of the castle
in the Angevin documents; Greek fire was deposited there, its well is
the subject of several inquiries, and it served as a base for Charles I’s
designs upon the Greek Empire, which were cut short by the Sicilian
Vespers. The chief Angevin officials were a castellan (usually a Frenchman,
<i>e.g.</i> Dreux de Vaux), a treasurer, and more rarely a “captain” of
the town, who was subordinate to the castellan, who was in his turn
under the Captain and Vicar-General of Albania. The garrison sometimes
consisted of Saracens from Lucera, and its fidelity could not always be
trusted, for a commission was on one occasion sent over to inquire
whether it had sold munitions to the Greek enemies of the Angevins.
Nor was the harbour, which the Venetians frequented, free from pirates<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>.
After the death of the vigorous Despot Michael II, it was not so much
from his feeble successor, Nikephoros I of Epeiros, as from the able and
energetic Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, that the Angevins had to
fear attacks upon Valona, especially after the defeat of their army and
the capture of its commander at Berat in 1281. There is no documentary
evidence of the presence of any Angevin governor after 1284 at Valona,
which, between that date and 1297, when we find a certain “Calemanus”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
described as “Duke” of the Spinarza district, and, therefore, almost
certainly of Valona also, must have been occupied by the Byzantines<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>.
Nevertheless, the Angevins continued to regard the Epeirote lands of
Manfred and Chinardo as theirs on paper. They are mentioned in the
ratification of the treaty of Viterbo by the titular Latin Empress
Catherine in 1294, by which they were confirmed to King Charles II,
who in the same year transferred them to his son Philip of Taranto<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>,
then about to marry Thamar, daughter and heiress of the Despot
Nikephoros I of Epeiros.</p>

<p>The Byzantines evidently attached considerable importance to
Valona and its district, for the successive Byzantine governors were
men of family and position: Andronikos Asan Palaiologos, subsequently
governor of the Byzantine province in the Morea, who was son of the
Bulgarian Tsar, John Asên III, connected with the reigning imperial
family, and father-in-law of the future Emperor John Cantacuzene;
Constantine Palaiologos, son of Andronikos II; and a Laskaris<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>. Under
these exalted personages were minor officials, such as George Ganza, a
friend of the Despot Thomas of Epeiros, and his son Nicholas, who
successively held the office of Admiral of Valona for over twenty years,
while the latter on one occasion grandiloquently styles himself <i>protosevastos
et protovestiarius et primus camerlengus</i> of the Emperor; the
<i>sevastos</i> Theodore Lykoudas, and Michael Malagaris, prefect of the castle
of Kanina<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>. During this second Byzantine period, when Valona was
<i>civitas Imperatoris Grecorum</i> (as a document styles it), there was a
considerable trade with both Ragusa and Venice, and a colony of
resident Venetian merchants there. Occasionally, however, serious
quarrels arose between the Ganza family and the Ragusans and
Venetians, who demanded satisfaction from the Emperor, and on one
occasion Ganza’s son was killed. That there was likewise traffic with the
opposite Italian coast is clear from King Robert of Naples’ repeated
orders to his subjects to export nothing to a place which belonged to the
hostile Byzantine Empire, and to which the Angevins still maintained
their claims. For as late as 1328 Philip of Taranto named a certain
Raimond de Termes commander of Berat and Valona<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>, and death alone
prevented him and his brother, John of Gravina, who in 1332 received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
the kingdom of Albania with the town of Durazzo in exchange for the
principality of the Morea, from prosecuting the Angevin claims. The
Albanians, however, rose and attacked Berat and Kanina in 1335, but
were speedily suppressed by Andronikos III, the first Emperor who had
visited Albania since Manuel I<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>.</p>

<p>But a more formidable enemy than Angevins or Albanians now
threatened Valona. The great Serbian Tsar, Stephen Dushan, was now
making Serbia the dominant power of the Balkan peninsula, and the
value of the harbour of Valona and the castle of Kanina could scarcely
escape the notice of that remarkable man. An entry in a Serbian psalter
informs us that the Serbs took Valona and Kanina<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> in the last four
months of 1345 or in the early months of 1346, and Serbian they
remained till the Turkish conquest. Dushan, like the Byzantines,
showed his appreciation of these places by appointing as governor of
Valona, Kanina and Berat his brother-in-law, John Comnenos Asên,
brother of the Bulgarian Tsar, John Alexander. This Serbian governor,
a Bulgar by birth, married Anna Palaiologina, widow of the Despot
John II of Epeiros, and mother of the last Despot of Epeiros, Nikephoros
II, and became so far Hellenised as to take the name of Comnenos
(borne by the Greek Despots of Epeiros, whose successor he pretended
to be, and whose title of “Despot” he adopted), and to sign his name in
Greek in the two Slav documents which he has bequeathed to us<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>.
Although, like his predecessors, he preyed upon Venetian and other
shipping at Valona, for which the mighty Serbian Tsar paid compensation,
he became a Venetian citizen<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>, and was allowed to obtain weapons
in Venice for the defence of Cheimarra and its port of Palermo from
Sicilian pirates<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>. After the death of Dushan and in the confusion which
ensued he embraced the cause of the latter’s half-brother, the Tsar
Symeon, who had married his step-daughter, Thomais, against Dushan’s
son, and he is last mentioned in 1363, when nearly all the Venetians at
Valona died of the plague, and he perhaps with them<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>. Alexander,
perhaps his son, followed him as “Lord of Kanina and Valona,” and
allied himself with Ragusa<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>, of which he became a citizen. The name of
Porto Raguseo (Pasha Liman of the Turks), at the mouth of the Dukati<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
valley on the bay of Valona, still preserves the memory of this connection,
and was the harbour of the “argosies” of the South Slavonic Republic,
whose merchants had their quarters half-way between Valona and
Kanina.</p>

<p>In 1371 those places came into the possession of the family of Balsha,
of Serbian origin, which a few years earlier had founded a dynasty in
what is now Montenegro. Balsha II, who with his two brothers had
already taken Antivari and Scutari (“their principal domicile”), killed
a certain George, perhaps Alexander’s son—for Alexander is thought
to have perished by the side of Vukashin at the battle of the Maritza
in 1371—and in a Venetian document of the next year is described as
“Lord of Valona.” In consequence of his usurpation the inhabitants
of Valona fled for refuge to the islet of Saseno in the bay, and placed
themselves under the protection of Venice<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>. Under Balsha II Valona
formed part of a considerable principality, for on the death of his last
surviving brother, in 1378, the “Lord of Valona and Budua” had become
sole ruler of the Zeta—the modern Montenegro—and then, by the
capture of Durazzo from Carlo Topia, “Prince of Albania,” assumed the
title of “Duke” from that former Venetian duchy. By his marriage
with Comita Musachi, he became connected with a powerful Albanian
clan<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>; but his ambition caused his death, for Carlo Topia begged the
Turks to restore him to Durazzo, while Balsha, like other Christian rulers
of his time, instead of concentrating all his forces against the Turkish
peril, wasted them in fighting against Tvrtko I, the great King of Bosnia,
for the possession of Cattaro. Consequently, when the Turks marched
against him, he could raise only a small army to oppose them; he fell
in battle on the Vojussa in 1385, and his head was sent as a trophy to
the Sultan.</p>

<p>Upon his death his dominions were divided; Valona with Kanina,
Saseno, Cheimarra, and “the tower of Pyrgos<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>” alone remained to his
widow. Left with only a daughter, Regina, she felt unable to defend
all these places from the advancing Turks; so, in 1386, she offered “the
castle and town of Valona” to Venice on “certain conditions<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>.” The
cautious Republic replied that her offer would be accepted, if she would
hand over freely “the castle of Kanina with its district and the town of
Valona with its district.” This shows that the Venetians, like their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
recent Italian representatives, realised that Valona required Kanina
for its defence, as well as a certain <i>Hinterland</i>. The reply went on to add
that, in case she declined to accept this condition, Venice would be
content to take over these places, paying her half their rents for her life,
while she paid half their expenses. Under those circumstances, she could
remain at Valona, or come to Venice, as she chose. But, if she would
accept neither proposition, then Venice would be willing to take Kanina
and the other places, giving her all the rents for her life, on condition
that she paid all the expenses of their maintenance. Nothing came of
this negotiation; but in 1389 her envoy agreed to furnish three rowers
annually to the captain of the Venetian fleet in recognition of Venetian
dominion over the islet of Saseno, which commanded the bay. Thus
Venice, like the late Admiral Bettòlo, considered that the occupation
of that islet was sufficient. In 1393 Dame Comita Balsha made Venice
a second offer of Valona. But, in the meantime, the battle of Kossovo
had been fought; the Serbian Empire had fallen, and it was obvious that
the Turks had become the most powerful Balkan state. Thus, although
Comita was ready to give Venice the men whom she had promised in
recognition of Venetian rights over “the towers of Pyrgos and Saseno,”
and disposed to cede Valona, her offer was declined with thanks, because
“we Venetians prefer our friends to remain in their own dominions and
govern them rather than we.” Two years later her envoy, the Bishop of
Albania, made a third offer of all the four places which she held: Valona,
Kanina, Cheimarra, and the tower of Pyrgos, provision being made for
her and her son-in-law that they might go where they liked and live
honourably there. This meant in cash 7000 ducats for their lives out of
the 9000 which the bishop estimated as the total revenue of the above
places. The Venetians ordered their Admiral to inquire into the state of
the places and the amount which they produced, before deciding, and
ere that Comita died<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>.</p>

<p>She was succeeded by her son-in-law, “Marchisa” (or Merksha)
Jarkovich, “King of Serbia,” a near relative of her own by blood and
a cousin of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II. He must, therefore, have
been a relative of the latter’s Serbian wife, who was a daughter of
Constantine Dragash, Despot of part of Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>. He at once, in
1396, offered to cede Valona, Cheimarra, Berat, and the tower of Pyrgos
to Venice, but was told that his offer could not be accepted till the
Venetians had accurate information about them. He then turned to
Ragusa, of which he became an honorary citizen with leave to deposit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
all his property there for safety. In 1398 he again applied to Venice,
because he did not see how he could defend his lands against the Turks.
Venice thought it undesirable that they should become Turkish, but
decided first to send her Admiral to inquire into their revenues, cost,
and condition, expressing a preference for leaving them in their present
ruler’s hands. In 1400, as this inquiry had not yet been made, another
envoy was sent from Valona to Venice, only to receive the same answer.
Upon Merksha’s death, his widow sent yet another envoy to Venice in
1415, with a like result, and was reminded of her late husband’s and her
subjects’ debts to the Republic. Then the end came; a document of
July 21, 1418, informs us that Valona had fallen into the hands of the
Turks<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>. Consequently, lest they should attack the Venetian colony of
Corfù or passing Venetian ships, the Venetian bailie, who was about to
proceed to Constantinople, was instructed to endeavour to obtain its
restitution with that of Kanina and its other appurtenances to Regina
Balsha, whose husband had been, like herself, a Venetian citizen. If
the Sultan refused, then the bailie was authorised to offer up to 8000
ducats for Regina’s former possessions, and another offer was made in
1424<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>. The Turks, however, retained Valona continuously for 273 years,
and, with one brief interval, for 495.</p>

<p>There is little record of its history in the Turkish period. In June,
1436, Cyriacus of Ancona spent two days there, and copied a Greek
inscription which he found on a marble base at the Church of Georgios
Tropæophoros<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>. In 1466 Venice was alarmed at the repairs executed
there by its new masters, which endangered Venetian interests owing to
its proximity to the Republic’s colonies in that part of the world—Corfù
and its dependencies, in the south, and Durazzo, Alessio, Dulcigno,
Antivari, Dagno, Satti, Scutari and Drivasto, in the north—and to the
quantity of wood for shipbuilding which it could furnish. Accordingly,
the Republic suggested to Skanderbeg to attack it with his own forces,
and with Venetian and colonial troops<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>. Nothing came of this suggestion,
but in 1472 a Corfiote, John Vlastos, offered to consign Valona and
Kanina to Venice on condition of receiving a fixed sum down and an
annuity; and the Republic instructed the Governor of Corfù to enter
into negotiations with him<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>. This also failed, and Valona, in Turkish
hands, became, as had been feared, a base for attack against the Ionian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
Islands and even Italy. Thence, in 1479, the Turks moved against the
remaining possessions of Leonardo III Tocco, Count of Cephalonia;
thence, in the following year, they sailed to take Otranto<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>. In 1501,
during the Turco-Venetian war, Benedetto Pesaro entered the bay of
Valona with a flotilla of light vessels, but a sudden hurricane caused the
death by drowning of all his men except those taken prisoners by the
Turks<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>. In 1518 the Governor of Valona, a renegade Cheimarriote,
succeeded, with the aid of Sinan Pasha, the Turkish Admiral, in compelling
Cheimarra to accept Turkish suzerainty by the concession of
large privileges. Sinan was so greatly pleased with Valona that he
became its governor. In the same year two Turkish subjects attempted
from Valona a <i>coup de main</i> upon Corfù, and it was there that the former
of the two great Turkish sieges of that island, that of 1537, was decided
upon by Suleyman I<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>. In 1570 a further descent was made from Valona,
where the Turks had established a cannon-foundry, upon Corfù<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>. In 1638
the attack by the Venetian fleet upon certain Tunisian and Algerian ships
off Valona nearly provoked war with Turkey, and led to a temporary
prohibition of trade between the inhabitants of that and of other Turkish
possessions and Venice<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>.</p>

<p>The Turco-Venetian war towards the close of the seventeenth century
led at last to the Venetian occupation of Valona, then a place of 150
houses surrounded by a low wall. The motives were the fertility of the
district and the desire to expel the Barbary corsairs. Morosini’s successor,
Girolamo Cornaro, accompanied by many Greeks, after being delayed
two days by a storm off Saseno, landed at Kryoneri, a little to the south
of the town, early in September, 1690, where he was joined by 500
Cheimarriotes and Albanians. A Turkish attempt to prevent his landing
was repulsed; Kanina, weakly fortified by crumbling walls, was forced
to surrender, and its fall had as a natural consequence the capitulation
of Valona without a blow. Cornaro, leaving Giovanni Matteo Bembo
and Teodoro Cornaro as <i>provveditori</i> of Valona and Kanina, proceeded
to attack Durazzo, but was forced by a storm to return to Valona, where,
on October 1, he died<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>. Venice intended at first to keep these two
acquisitions. Carlo Pisani was ordered to remain at “Uroglia” (Gervolia
opposite Corfù) with four galleys for their defence, while the
fortifications of Kanina were repaired and cisterns made. But when the
Capitan Pasha encamped on the banks of the Vojussa to intimidate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
Albanians, many of whom wished to join Venice, the garrisons began to
suffer from lack of food and consequent desertions. Thereupon, Domenico
Mocenigo, the new Venetian Captain-General, proposed and carried out
the demolition of Kanina by mines, and wrote to the home government
advocating the destruction of Valona on the ground that its preservation
would cripple the campaign in the Morea. A debate upon its fate
followed in the Senate. Francesco Foscari urged its retention on account
of its geographical position at the mouth of the Adriatic and on a fine
bay, well supplied with fresh water from Kryoneri (or “Acqua Fredda”).
He alluded to the valuable oak forests in the neighbourhood, whose
acorns furnished the substance known by the topical name of <i>valonea</i>
to dyers, to the ancient pitch-mines, the salt-pans, and the fisheries.
To these material considerations he added the loss of prestige involved
in the surrender of a place whose capture had been celebrated with joy
by Pope Alexander VIII and announced as an important event to the
King of Spain, because it signified the destruction of the corsairs, so long
the terror of the Papal and Neapolitan coast of the Adriatic. Besides,
“Valona,” he concluded, “opens for us the door into Albania.” To him
Michele Foscarini replied, proposing to leave the decision to the naval
council, and this proposal was adopted. Mocenigo’s first idea had always
been to abandon the place, and his resolve was confirmed by the advance
of the Turkish troops under Chalil Pasha; but General Charles Sparre,
a Swedish baron, who was sent to execute his orders, found that the
rapid approach of the enemy made such an operation too dangerous.
The Venetians accordingly burnt the suburb, but prepared to defend
the town. But at the outset both Bembo and Sparre were killed by the
Turkish artillery fire, and, though the garrison made a successful sortie,
the Captain-General repeated his order to blow up Valona. Four cannon
and one mortar were left there to deceive the Turks, and on March 13,
1691, after a siege of forty days, they too were removed and Valona
evacuated and destroyed. The Turks offered no opposition to the retreating
Venetians, and the opinion was freely expressed that the place could
have been defended. Thus, after six months, ended the Venetian
occupation of Valona<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>. When Pouqueville<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> visited it rather more than
a century later, he saw the remains of the two forts blown up by the
Venetians, and found that one street with porticoes recalled their former
residence. In his time the population was 6000, including a certain
number of Jews banished from Ancona by Paul IV. The place was then,
as now, very unhealthy in summer, but he foretold a brilliant future
for it, if the marshes were once drained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span></p>

<p>The Turks neglected Valona, as they neglected all their Albanian
possessions. Sinan Pasha had been so good and popular a governor that,
although a native of Konieh, he was nicknamed “the Arnaut,” and his
descendants long held the appointment as almost a family fief; indeed,
as late as the middle of the eighteenth century, the natives of Valona
besieged and cut to pieces a certain Ismail Pasha, who had endeavoured
to wrest the governorship of the town from one of Sinan’s descendants<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>.
A generation later, however, a sanguinary feud, which broke out
between the members of this governing family, led the other notables
of Valona to invoke the intervention of the famous Ali Pasha of Joannina,
who had already cast covetous eyes on the place, then ruled by Ibrahim
Pasha. But the treacherous “Lion of Joannina” carried off not only
Ibrahim but also the notables of Valona to the dungeons of his lake-fortress,
where they were subsequently put to death. Ibrahim, however,
lingered on, and was forced to address a petition to the Turkish government
begging it, in consideration of his age and infirmities, to bestow
the governorship of Valona and Berat upon his gaoler’s eldest son,
Mouchtar Pasha, who appointed a Naxiote Christian, Damirales, as his
representative in the former town. In 1820 the Turkish authorities,
resolved to crush the too-powerful satrap of Joannina, easily induced
the people of Valona to drive out Mouchtar’s partisans. But the
population repeatedly gave the Turks cause for alarm, and in 1828
Rechid Pasha treacherously executed a powerful Bey of Valona, who
had come to pay his respects to him at Joannina. Nevertheless the local
people continued to resist any obnoxious Turkish authority<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>.</p>

<p>During the first Balkan war, on November 28, 1912, Albanian
independence was proclaimed at Valona, and an Albanian government
formed, of which Ismail Kemal Bey was President<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>. But when an
Albanian principality was created in the following year, and Prince
William of Wied was chosen as its ruler, Valona recognised Durazzo
as the capital. Meanwhile, Italy had intimated that she could not
consent to the inclusion of Valona, to which she attached special
importance, within the new Greek frontier; and insisted on the islet of
Saseno, which had formed part of the Hellenic kingdom since 1864,
being ceded to the Albanian principality. Greece complied with this
demand, and on July 15, 1914, the Greek garrison abandoned Saseno
at the order of the Venizelos Cabinet. When the European war broke
out, Italy took the opportunity, on October 30, to occupy Saseno by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
troops under the command of Admiral Patris, who found it inhabited
by twenty-one persons, and re-christened the highest point “Monte
Bandiera” from the Italian flag which was hoisted there<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>. She had sent
a sanitary mission to Valona itself and, on December 25, occupied that
town. Then, as in 1690 and as in the days of Manfred and his successors,
Kanina was likewise in Italian hands, while for the first time in its long
history Valona has been connected with Great Britain, for the new jetty
there was the work of the British Adriatic Mission, sent to rescue the
retreating Serbian army. But, by the Tirana agreement of August 3,
1920, Italy renounced Valona (assigned to her by the treaty of London
in 1915), and now holds Saseno alone.</p>

<h3 id="heading23">2. THE MEDIÆVAL SERBIAN EMPIRE</h3>

<p>The late Professor Freeman once remarked during a great crisis in
the Balkans, that it was the business of a Minister of Foreign Affairs
“to know something of the history of foreign countries.” The demand,
however unreasonable it may seem, derives special importance from
the fact, that recent events have signally justified the forecasts of the
eminent historian and signally falsified those of the Minister whom he
was criticising. For in the Balkans, and especially in Greece and Serbia,
history is not, as it is apt to be in some western countries, primarily
a subject for examinations, but is, thanks to the popular ballads, an
integral part of the national life and a powerful factor in contemporary
politics. The glories of the Byzantine Empire exercise a continual
fascination upon the Greeks; the conquests of the Tsar Stephen Dushan
in Macedonia have been invoked as one of the Serbian claims to that
disputed land; whereas no Englishman of to-day has been known to
demand a large part of France on the ground that it belonged to the
English Crown in the reign of Dushan’s contemporary, Edward III.</p>

<p>But there is a further reason for the study of Balkan history by
practical men. Our judgments of the Balkan peoples are often harsh and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
unjust, because we do not realise the historic fact that they stepped
straight out of the fifteenth century into the nineteenth (and in some
cases into the twentieth), like Plato’s cave-dwellers who emerged
suddenly from darkness into the full light of day. For the centuries of
Turkish rule, interrupted in the case of Northern Serbia by the twenty-one
years of Austrian rule between the treaties of Passarovitz and
Belgrade in the eighteenth century, left them much as it found them—with
their material resources undeveloped, their roads reduced to mule-tracks,
their harbours undredged, their education neglected. Consequently,
it was manifestly unfair to expect those who were practically contemporaries
of our Wars of the Roses to enter the nineteenth century with
the same ideas and the same culture as the gradually evolved states of
Western Europe. The wonder rather is that so much progress has been
accomplished in so short a time, especially when we remember that the
eminent personages who direct the affairs of this world are apt to regard
the Balkan peoples, with their deeply-rooted historical traditions and
aspirations, and their extraordinarily keen sense of nationality,
immensely stimulated by the victories of 1912-13, as pawns in a game,
to be moved about the board as its exigencies demand. Let us Western
Europeans, then, who have had no personal experience of Turkish rule,
be less censorious of those who have lived under it for nearly four
centuries at Semendria and for five at Skopje.</p>

<p>In the following pages I propose to give a general sketch of mediæval
Serbian history, emphasising those points which may help us to understand
the events of the last few years, and referring those who desire
further details to the great (if unpolished and unfinished) work of the
late Constantin Jireček, who for the first time has placed the history
of the Serbs in the Middle Ages upon the impregnable rock of contemporary
documentary evidence.</p>

<p>The Serbs, like the Bulgars, are not original inhabitants of the
Balkan peninsula, where, at the dawn of history, we find three principal
races—the Greeks, the Illyrians (who are perhaps the ancestors of the
Albanians), and the Thracians. But a continuous residence of thirteen
centuries qualifies the Serbs to be considered a Balkan people. The
usually received account of their entry into the peninsula is that given
by the Byzantine Emperor, Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in his
treatise “De Administrando Imperio,” written some three centuries
later. He tells us that the Emperor Herakleios (610-41) gave them the
territory which was later called “Serblia”—a country bounded in the
time of Porphyrogenitus by Croatia on the north, Bulgaria on the
south, the river Rashka near Novibazar on the east, and the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
Herzegovina on the west. But a chain of historical facts proves that
Herakleios merely gave to the Serbs what they had already taken.
About a century before his time the Slavs, whose oldest home was in
Poland, had begun to cross the Danube, and about 578 had actually
appeared before Salonika. Herakleios, occupied with the war against
the Persians in the East, could not defend the Western Balkans. So he
made a virtue of necessity, just as, in our own day, governments have
granted autonomy to lost provinces which they could no longer protect.
The Danubian principalities, Bulgaria, Eastern Roumelia, Crete, and the
Lebanon are examples.</p>

<p>This arrangement suited both parties. The Byzantine Court could
keep up a formal suzerainty, and Constantine Porphyrogenitus could
point in proof of it to the quite unscientific etymology of the word
“Serboi” from the Latin <i>servi</i>, because they had become the “slaves”
of the Byzantine Emperor. This national name, which first occurs in the
ninth century, when we find Eginhard, the biographer of Charlemagne,
describing in 822 the “Sorabi” as “said to occupy a large part of
Dalmatia,” is still applied not only to the Balkan Serbs but to those of
Saxony, whose language, however, is so different that a Serb of Bautzen
cannot understand a Serb of Belgrade. The later Byzantine historians, full
of classical lore, sometimes call the Serbs Τριβαλλοί after the Thracian
tribe, which occupied in antiquity part of modern Serbia, and the king
of which is brought on the stage and made to talk broken Greek in
the <i>Birds</i> of Aristophanes. Yet, despite this false etymology of their
name, Constantine Porphyrogenitus himself admits what was doubtless
the fact, that the Croats and Serbs were “subject to none.” “Thus,”
in the words of Finlay<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>, “the modern history of the eastern shores of
the Adriatic commences with the establishment of the Sclavonian
colonies in Dalmatia.” Of the two pre-existing elements in the population,
the Romans, as Constantine Porphyrogenitus says, retired into
the coast-towns, while the Illyrian aborigines were pushed southward
into the country which since the eleventh century has borne the name
of Albania from the district of Albanon near Kroja. Under the name of
Ἀρβανῖται the Albanians are first mentioned in 1079.</p>

<p>The history of mediæval Serbia falls naturally into three sections:
(1) from the entry of the Serbs into the Balkan peninsula to the close
of the twelfth century—a period during which the Byzantine Empire,
after finally crushing the Bulgarians, dominated the Near East, and the
Serbs, divided into two separate states, played a subordinate but restive
part; (2) from the rise of the Nemanja dynasty towards the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
twelfth century to the battle of Kossovo in 1389—a period which saw
Serbia rise to be for a brief space by far the greatest state in the peninsula;
(3) the decline, when Danubian Serbia existed at the pleasure of the
Turks, till in 1459 she received her death-blow.</p>

<p>During the first of these periods the only serious resistance to the
Byzantine hegemony of the Balkan peninsula was offered by the
Bulgarians—a Finnish, or, according to others, Tartar tribe, which
entered it in 679, and became gradually absorbed in the Slavonic
population, which it had conquered. The vanquished imposed their
language upon the victors, but the victors, like the Angles in England,
imposed their name upon the vanquished. Two powerful Bulgarian
monarchs, Krum and the Tsar Symeon, in 813 and 913 threatened the
very existence of Constantinople, as did the Tsar Ferdinand in 1913;
and Krum was wont to pledge his nobles out of the silver-set skull of
the Greek Emperor Nikephoros I, whom he had slain in battle. The
Serbs, however, maintained friendly relations with these powerful
neighbours till about the middle of the ninth century, when history
registers the first of the long series of Serbo-Bulgarian wars, of which we
have seen three in our own time. When the Serbs were united, they were
able to defeat the Bulgars. But the rivalry of the hereditary princes,
whom we find ruling over them at this period, led to the formation of
pro-Bulgar and pro-Byzantine parties, so that the native ruler tended
to become a Bulgarian or Byzantine nominee, while there was a
pretender in exile at Prêslav or Constantinople only awaiting the
opportunity to be restored by foreign aid. About 924, however, the
Bulgarian Tsar Symeon, instead of placing a puppet of his own on the
throne, carried away almost the whole Serbian people captive into
Bulgaria. Serbia thus remained barren; and when, after Symeon’s
death, the Serbian prince, Tchaslav, escaped from the Bulgarian court
to Serbia, he found there only fifty men, and neither women nor
children. By submitting to the Byzantine Emperor and with the latter’s
help, he restored the scattered Serbs to their own country.</p>

<p>For the rest of the tenth century Serbian history is a blank, save for
the survival of the leaden seal with a Greek inscription belonging to a
Prince of Diokleia, the country called after the town of Doclea, whose
ruins still stand near Podgoritza. This was the time of the great
Bulgarian Tsar Samuel, under whom Bulgaria stretched to the Adriatic;
and Durazzo, the key of the Western Balkans, as Byzantine statesmen
considered it, became a Bulgarian port. In his days there lived on the
lake of Scutari a saintly Serbian prince, John Vladimir. Samuel carried
off this holy man to his own capital on the lake of Prespa. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
Tsar’s daughter, according to the story, was so greatly moved by his
pious speeches and his beauty while engaged in washing his feet, that
she begged her father to release him. The saint escaped prison but not
matrimony; he married the love-sick Bulgarian princess; but not long
after was murdered as he was leaving church by an usurper of the
Bulgarian throne. His remains repose in the monastery of St John near
Elbassan; his cross is still preserved in Montenegro and carried every
Whitsunday in procession at dawn.</p>

<p>The complete destruction of the first Bulgarian Empire by the
Byzantine Emperor Basil II, “the Bulgar-slayer,” in 1018, removed the
danger of a Bulgarian hegemony in the Balkans, and made the Danube
again the frontier of the Byzantine dominions, which surrounded on
three sides the Serbian lands. Manuel I added Σερβικός to the Imperial
style; Serbian pretenders were kept ready at Constantinople or Durazzo,
in case the Serbian rulers showed signs of independence, while high-sounding
court titles rewarded their servility. The internal condition
of the Serbian people favoured Byzantine policy. For them, as in our
own day, there were two Serb states, and two national dynasties, one
ruling over the South Dalmatian coast, the present Herzegovina, and
Dioklitia, modern Montenegro, with Scutari and Cattaro for its capitals;
the other governing the more inland districts from a central point in the
valley of the Rashka (near Novibazar), whence Serbia obtained the name
of “Rassia,” by which she was largely described in the West of Europe
during the Middle Ages. Of these two dynasties the former assumed
the royal title—Hildebrand addressed a letter to “Michael, King of the
Slavs”—but the latter became the more important, although its head
contented himself with the more modest designation of “Great <i>jupan</i>,”
that is, the first among the <i>jupani</i>, or Counts (Serbian <i>jupa</i> = county).</p>

<p>Whenever opportunity offered, however, the Serbs endeavoured to
emancipate themselves from Byzantium. Kedrenos informs us that
“after the death of the Emperor Romanos III (in 1034) Serbia threw
off the yoke of the Greeks”; Stephen Vojislav, ruler of Dioklitia, not
only seized a cargo of gold, which was thrown up on the Illyrian coast,
but saw a Byzantine army perish in the difficult passes of his country.
A second Imperial invasion, which started from Durazzo, met with the
same fate as that which befell the Austrian “punitive expedition” in
December 1914. The Serbs allowed the invaders to penetrate into the
Zeta valley, occupied the heights and utterly routed them as they
returned, laden with booty, through a narrow gorge. Michael, Vojislav’s
son, made peace with the Emperor, and received the title of <i>protospathários</i>,
or “sword-bearer,” at the Byzantine court, while he assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
at home the title of king. But, after the crushing defeat of the Byzantines
by the Seljuks in Asia at the battle of Manzikert in 1071, the temptation
to rise was too strong for the Balkan Slavs to resist. Accordingly, at
the invitation of the Bulgarians, Michael sent them a leader in the person
of his son, Constantine Bodin, who was proclaimed at Prizren “Peter,
Emperor of the Bulgarians.” Bodin was, however, captured by the
Byzantines, but escaped and married the daughter of a citizen of Bari—the
first example but not the last of a Serbo-Italian union. At his
request Pope Clement III confirmed the rights of the Archbishopric of
Antivari, the ancient See, which is mentioned as an Archbishopric so
early as 1067, and on the holder of which Leo XIII in 1902 conferred the
title of “Primate of Serbia.” But Bodin, bellicose and crafty as Anna
Comnena describes him, fell again into the power of the Byzantines.
Our countryman, Ordericus Vitalis, describes him as “treating in a
friendly fashion” the Crusaders who passed through his territory.
Usually, however, the Crusaders had difficulty with the Serbs; and
William of Tyre tells how at Nish, then a “fortified town, filled with a
valiant and numerous population,” certain “Germans, sons of Belial,”
set fire to the mills, thus provoking the retaliation of the natives.</p>

<p>The excellent Archbishop, who was sent in 1168 on an embassy to
Monastir, remarks that Serbia was a country “of difficult access”; and
that the Serbs, whose name he also derives from their supposedly original
state of servitude, were “an uncultured and undisciplined people,
inhabiting the mountains and forests, and not practising agriculture,
but possessed of much cattle great and small.... Sometimes their <i>jupani</i>
obey the Emperor: at other times all the inhabitants quit their mountains
and forests ... to ravage the surrounding countries.” Yet the oldest piece
of Serbian literature—a book of the Gospels in Cyrillic letters<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>—dates
from this very period; and a priest of Antivari composed in Latin a
history of the rulers of Diokleia, who were gradually ousted by the
“Great <i>jupani</i>” of Rascia, who in their turn were forced to submit to
the chivalrous Byzantine Emperor, Manuel I. A court poet of the period,
Theodore Prodromos, represents the Serbian rivers Save and Tara, red
with blood and laden with corpses, addressing the conqueror, and the
Serbian <i>jupani</i> trembling at the roar of the lion from the Bosporus.</p>

<p>The death of Manuel I, in 1180, freed the Southern Slavs from
Byzantine rule; and the following decade saw the foundation of the
great Serbian state, which reached its zenith in the middle of the
fourteenth century, and then fell before the all-conquering Turk. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
has usually happened in Balkan history, this national triumph was
the work of one man—Stephen Nemanja, the first great name in Serbian
history.</p>

<p>The founder of the Serbian monarchy was a native of what is now
Podgoritza, whence he built up a compact Serbian state, comprising the
Zeta (modern Montenegro), and the Land of Hum (the “Hill” country,
now the Herzegovina), Northern Albania and the modern kingdom of
Serbia, with a sea-frontage on the Bocche di Cattaro, whose municipality
in 1186 passed a resolution describing him as “Our Lord Nemanja,
Great <i>jupan</i> of Rascia.” Of the Serbian lands Bosnia alone evaded his
sway, forming a separate state, which, first under <i>bans</i>, and then under
kings, survived the Serbian monarchy till it, too, fell before the Turks;
while in the land of Hum he set up his brother, Miroslav, as prince. Thus,
he substituted for the aristocratic Serbian federation a single state,
embraced the Orthodox faith, which was that of the majority of his
people, and strove to secure its religious as well as ecclesiastical union
by extirpating the heresy of the Bogomiles, or <i>Babuni</i> (whence the name
of the Babuna pass near Monastir, so famous in the fighting of 1915),
then rife in the Balkans. At the same time he sent presents to St Peter’s
in Rome and St Nicholas’ at Bari.</p>

<p>When Frederick Barbarossa stopped at Nish on the third Crusade
in 1189, Nemanja met him with handsome gifts; but we may doubt
the statement of a German chronicler that he did homage for his lands
to the Teutonic ruler. No German Emperor ever set foot in Nish again
till the recent visit of the Kaiser to King Ferdinand, when a modern
chronicle, the <i>Wolffbureau</i>, revived the memory of Barbarossa’s presence
there. In 1195 Nemanja retired from the world, at the instigation of
his youngest son, who is known in Serbian history as St Sava; and he
died in 1200 as the monk Symeon in the monastery of Chilandar on
Mount Athos. He, too, received the honours of a saint; his tomb is still
revered in the monastery of Studenitza, which he founded; and his life
was written by his eldest son and successor Stephen, and by Stephen’s
brother St Sava—the beginning of Serbian historical biography.</p>

<p>Nemanja had never assumed the title of king, continuing to style
himself as “Great <i>jupan</i>”; but Stephen won for himself the title of
“the first-crowned king,” by obtaining, in 1217, a royal crown from
Pope Honorius III. There were diplomatic reasons for the assumption
of this title. The Byzantine Empire had now fallen before the Latin
Crusaders; Frankish principalities had arisen all over the Near East;
and the Latin ruler of Salonika had assumed the royal style. Bulgaria
had arisen again, and her sovereigns had revived the ancient title of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
Tsar; and the King of Hungary had presumed to call himself king of
“Rascia” also. To show his connection with the former kings of Diokleia,
Stephen added that country to his style; to complete the independence
of his kingdom, he obtained through his saintly and diplomatic brother
from the Œcumenical Patriarch at Nice the recognition of a separate
Serbian Church under Sava himself as “Archbishop of all the Serbian
lands.” Sava was buried in the monastery of Mileshevo in the old
<i>sandjak</i> of Novibazar, whence his remains were removed and burned
by the Turks near Belgrade in 1595. Many a pious legend has grown up
around the name of the founder of the national Church; but, through
the haze of romance and beneath the halo of the saint, we can descry
the figure of the great ecclesiastical statesman, whose constant aim it
was to benefit his country and the dynasty to which he himself belonged,
and to identify the latter with the national religion.</p>

<p>While Stephen’s successor was a feeble character, the second Bulgarian
Empire reached its zenith under the great Tsar John Asên II, who
boasted in a still extant inscription in his capital of Trnovo, then the
centre of Balkan politics, that he had “conquered all the lands from
Adrianople to Durazzo.” The next Serbian King Vladislav was his son-in-law;
St Sava died as his guest. But the hegemony of Bulgaria
disappeared at his death in 1241; there, too, the national resurrection
had been the work of one man. The Greeks regained their influence in
Macedonia, and in 1261 recaptured Constantinople from the Latins.</p>

<p>We have an interesting description of life at the Serbian court in the
time of the next King, Stephen Urosh I<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> (<i>c.</i> 1268), from the Byzantine
historian Pachymeres. There was a project for a marriage between a
daughter of the Greek Emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos, and a son
of Stephen Urosh. First, however, two envoys were sent to report, and
the Empress specially charged one of them to let her know what sort
of a family it was into which her daughter was about to marry. The
pompous Byzantines were horrified to find “the great King,” as he was
called, living the simple life in a way which would have disgraced a
modest official of Constantinople, his Hungarian daughter-in-law working
at her spindle in an inexpensive gown, and his household eating like
a pack of hunters or sheep-stealers. The lack of security for travellers
deepened the unfavourable impression of the envoys, and the marriage
was broken off. Stephen Urosh II (1281-1321), surnamed Milutin (“the
child of grace”), greatly increased the importance of Serbia. We have
different pictures of this monarch from his Serbian and his Greek
contemporaries. One of the former extols his qualities as a ruler, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
of the latter portrays him as anything but an exemplary husband. But
these characters are not incompatible, as we know from the case of
Henry VIII, whom Stephen Urosh II resembled not only in the number
of his wives, but in his opportunist policy. His chief object was to
enlarge his dominions at the expense of Byzantium; he occupied Skopje,
and established his capital there—the Serbian residence had hitherto
fluctuated between Novibazar, Prishtina and Prizren—and so greatly
impressed the Emperor Andronikos II with his advance towards Salonika
that the latter sacrificed his only daughter, Simonis, to the already thrice-divorced
monarch, giving as her dowry the territories which his son-in-law
had already taken from him. Simonis, however, when she grew
up—she was only a child at the time of her engagement—preferred
Constantinople to the society of her husband; and nothing but his threat
to come and take her by force induced her to return.</p>

<p>Behind this marriage of convenience there lay the project of uniting
the Greek and Serbian dominions under a Serbian sceptre—a project
to which the national party was resolutely opposed. At the same time,
he not only had—what all Serbian rulers have coveted—an outlet on
the sea, but actually occupied for a few years the port of Durazzo, that
much-debated spot, which during the Middle Ages was alternatively
Angevin, Serbian, Albanian and Venetian, till in 1501 it became Turkish.
Nor was this astute ruler only a diplomatist and a politician; he offered
the Venetians to keep open and guard the great trade route which
traversed his kingdom, and led across Bulgaria to the Black Sea. A
munificent founder of churches, his generosity is evidenced in Italy
by the silver altar, bearing the date 1319, which he gave to St Nicholas’
at Bari, and on which he described himself as ruling from the Adriatic
to the Danube; but his name is better known by the verses of Dante, who
has given him a place in the <i>Paradiso</i> among the evil kings for his
issue of counterfeit Venetian coin<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>—a common offence in the Levant
during the Middle Ages:</p>

<p>A disputed succession soon ended in the enthronement of the late
King’s illegitimate son, Stephen Urosh III, known in history by the
epithet “Detchanski” from the famous monastery of Detchani which
he founded. He had been blinded for conspiring against his father; but
on his father’s death he recovered his sight, which perhaps he had never
entirely lost. His reign is one of the most dramatic in Serbian history,
for it affords an example of those sudden alternations of triumph and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
disaster characteristic of the Balkans, alike in the Middle Ages and in
our own day. On June 28, 1330, he utterly routed the Bulgarians at
Velbujd, as Köstendil was then called. Bulgaria became a vassal state
of Serbia, which had thus won the hegemony of the Balkan peninsula.
Next year, he was dethroned by his son, the famous Stephen Dushan,
and strangled in the castle of Zvetchan near Mitrovitza. A contemporary,
Guillaume Adam, Archbishop of Antivari, has left a description
of Serbia during this period. The palaces of the King and his nobles were
of wood, and surrounded by palisades; the only houses of stone were in
the Latin coast-towns. Yet “Rassia” was naturally a very rich land,
producing plenty of corn, wine and oil; it was well watered; its forests
were full of game, while five gold mines and as many of silver were
constantly worked.</p>

<p>The reign of Stephen Urosh IV, better known as Stephen Dushan
(1331-55), marks the zenith of Serbia. As a conqueror and as a lawgiver,
he resembled Napoleon; and his Empire, like that of Napoleon, crumbled
to pieces as soon as its creator had disappeared. In the former capacity,
he aimed at realising the dream of his grandfather, Stephen Urosh II,
of forming a great Serbian Empire on the ruins of Byzantium. The civil
war between the young Emperor John V Palaiologos, aided by his
Italian mother, Anne of Savoy, and the ambitious John Cantacuzene,
whose history is one of the most interesting sources for this period, was
Dushan’s opportunity. Both parties in the struggle made bids for his
support at the unfortified village of Prishtina, which had been the
Serbian capital. His price was nothing less than the whole Byzantine
Empire west of Kavalla, or, at least, of Salonika. Anne of Savoy, less
patriotic than her rival, offered him what he asked, if he would send her
Cantacuzene, then his guest, either alive or dead. But the Council of
twenty-four great officers of state, whom the Serbian Kings were wont
to consult, acting on the Queen’s advice, repudiated the suggestion of
assassinating a suppliant. Dushan allowed the rival Byzantine factions
to exhaust themselves; and, while they fought, he occupied one place
after another, till all Macedonia, except Salonika, was his.</p>

<p>With little exaggeration he wrote from Serres to the Doge of Venice,
which had conferred her citizenship upon him, styling himself “King
of Serbia, Diokleia, the land of Hum, the Zeta, Albania and the Maritime
region, partner in no small part of the Empire of Bulgaria, and lord of
almost all the Empire of Romania.” But for the ruler of so vast a realm
the title of King seemed insignificant, especially as his vassal, the ruler
of Bulgaria, bore the great name of Tsar. Accordingly, on Easter Sunday
1346, Dushan had himself crowned at Skopje, whither he had transferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
his capital, as “Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks.” Shortly before, he
had raised the Archbishop of Serbia to the dignity of Patriarch with
his seat at Petch; and the two Slav Patriarchs, the Bulgarian of Trnovo
and the Serbian of Petch, placed the crown upon his head. At the same
time, on the analogy of the Western Empire with its “King of the
Romans,” he had his son, Stephen Urosh V, proclaimed King. Byzantine
emblems and customs were introduced into the brand-new Serbian
Empire; the Tsar assumed the tiara and the double-eagle, and wrote to
the Doge, proposing an alliance for the conquest of Constantinople. In
the papal correspondence with Serbia we read of a Serbian “Sebastocrator,”
a “Great Logothete,” a “Cæsar,” and a “Despot”; the governors
of important Serbian cities, such as Cattaro and Scutari, were styled
“Counts”; those of minor places, like Antivari, “Captains.” Thus it is
easy to see why the whole Serbian world was thrilled when, in the first
Balkan war of 1912, the Crown Prince Alexander entered Skopje, the
coronation-city of Dushan—at the invitation of the Austrian Consul,
“to restore order”!</p>

<p>Dushan next extended his Empire to the south by the annexation
of Epeiros and Thessaly; and assigned Ætolia and Akarnania to his
brother, Symeon Urosh, and Thessaly and Joannina to the “Cæsar”
Preliub. His dominions now stretched to the Corinthian Gulf, and he
thought that it only remained to annex the independent Serb state of
Bosnia, and to capture Constantinople, establishing what a poetic
Montenegrin ruler of our day has called an “Empire of the Balkans.”
This would have embraced all the races of the variegated peninsula, and
perhaps kept the Turks—who, in 1353, had made their first permanent
settlement in Europe, by crossing the Dardanelles and occupying the
castle of Tzympe—beyond the Bosporus, and the Hungarians beyond
the Save. On St Michael’s day, 1355, he assembled his nobles, and asked
whether he should lead them against Byzantium or Buda-Pesth. To
their answer, that they would follow him, whithersoever he bade them,
his reply was “to Constantinople.” But on the way he fell ill of a fever,
and at Diavoli, on Dec. 20, he died, aged 48. No Serbian ruler had ever
approached so near the Imperial city; had he succeeded, and had
another Dushan succeeded him, the Turkish conquest 98 years later
might have been averted.</p>

<p>Great as were his conquests, the Serbian Napoleon was no mere
soldier. His code of law, the “Zakonik,” like the “Code Napoléon,” has
survived the vast but fleeting Empire of its author. Dushan’s law-book
is, indeed, largely based on previous legislation, such as the canon law of
the Greek Church, the statutes of Budua and other Adriatic coast-towns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
and, in the case of trial by jury, on an enactment of Stephen Urosh II.
For us, however, its chief value is the light which it throws upon Serbia’s
political and social condition in the golden age of the Empire.</p>

<p>Mediæval Serbia resembled neither of the Serb states of our day.
It was not, even under Dushan, an autocracy, like Montenegro before
1905, nor yet a democratic monarchy, like the modern Serbian kingdom;
but the powers of the monarch were limited by the influence of the great
nobles—a class stamped out at the Turkish conquest and never since
revived. Society consisted of the Sovereign; the ecclesiastical hierarchy,
ranging from the Patriarch to the village priest; the greater and lesser
nobles; the peasants, some free, others serfs bound to the soil; slaves,
servants for hire; and, at Cattaro and in a few inland places, small
communities of burghers. But the magnates were the dominant section;
on two occasions even Dushan had to cope with their rebellions, and
they formed a privy council of twenty-four, which he consulted before
deciding important questions of public policy. Their lands were
hereditary; and they enjoyed the privilege of killing their inferiors with
comparative impunity, for a graduated tariff (as in Saxon England)
regulated the punishment for wilful murder—hanging for that of a
priest or monk, burning for parricide, fratricide, or infanticide, the loss
of both hands and a fine for that of a noble by a commoner, a simple
fine for that of a commoner by a noble. But the law secured to the
peasant the fruits of his labour; no village might be laid under contribution
by two successive army-corps; but, if the peasant organised or even
attended a public meeting, he lost his eyes and was branded on the face,
while for theft or arson, the culprit’s village was held collectively
responsible. Next to the nobles the Orthodox Church was the most
influential class; indeed, the early Archbishops of Serbia were drawn
from junior members of the Royal family, and their interests were
consequently identical with those of the Crown, of which they were the
apologists in literature, like the “official” journals of to-day.</p>

<p>While the great Serbia of Dushan, like the smaller Serbia of our days,
was pre-eminently an agricultural state, it possessed the enormous
advantage of a coastline, which facilitated trade. Dushan allowed foreign
merchants to circulate freely, and showed special favour to those of
Ragusa whose argosies (or <i>ragusies</i>) were welcomed in his ports. He
allowed a Saxon colony to work the silver-mines of Novo Brdo, and to
burn charcoal. His bodyguard was composed of Germans, whose
captain, Palmann, obtained great influence with him. He sent missions
to foreign countries to obtain information; with Venice, of which he was
a citizen, his relations were particularly close—as those of Italians and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
Serbs ought by nature to be; while foreign ambassadors were favourably
impressed with his hospitality by receiving free meals in every village
through which they passed. Already—so Nikephoros Gregoras tells us—the
Serbs had begun to commemorate the great deeds of their
champions in their national ballads, which attained their full development
after the fatal battle of Kossovo and have inspired the Serbian
soldiers in their three last wars. We hear, too, of architects from Cattaro,
which was the Serbian mint in the reigns of Dushan and his son. The
Queen of Italy possesses a collection of the coinage of the mediæval
Serbian monarchy.</p>

<p>Dushan’s Empire crumbled away at his death. Like that of Napoleon,
it had been made too fast to weld together the four races which it
contained—Serbs, Greeks, Albanians and Koutso-Wallachs. The
creation of a Serbian Patriarchate alienated the Greek Church, just
as the creation of a Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870 sowed the seeds of
disunion between Greeks and Bulgarians in Macedonia. Thus to the four
different races there were added four different creeds—the Serbian
Patriarchists, the Greek Patriarchists, the Albanian Catholics, and the
Bogomile heretics, these last always ready to invoke a foreign invader
against domestic persecution, even though that foreigner were a
Mussulman. Even this strongest of Serbian monarchs, whose foot every
one who entered his presence must kiss and who was “of all men of his
time the tallest, and withal terrible to look upon,” as the papal legate
called him, was barely equal to the task of checking the great nobles;
and it was doubtless distrust of them which led him to surround himself
with a foreign guard. The eminent Serbian historian and statesman,
the late M. Novakovich, sums up the failure of Dushan to found a
permanent state in the judgment: “Everything about his Empire was
personal; the Serbian creations were only personal.”</p>

<p>The dying Tsar had made his nobles swear to maintain the rights of
his son, Stephen Urosh V, then a boy of nineteen. But the lad’s uncle,
Symeon Urosh, the viceroy of Akarnania and Ætolia, disputed the
succession; some nobles supported him, while others, availing themselves
of the family quarrel, set up as independent princes in their particular
satrapies. Symeon made Trikkala the capital of a brief Greco-Serbian
Empire; and his son ended as abbot of the famous monastery of Meteoron.
After four decades Serbian sway over Thessaly and Epeiros ceased to
exist. An inscription at Trikkala and a church at Meteoron are now
almost its only memories. Of the independent satraps the most important
were the brothers Balsha (by some erroneously connected with the
French house of Baux), who established themselves in the Zeta, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
present Montenegro, with a seaboard on the Adriatic at Budua and
Antivari, and with Scutari as their “principal residence”—“principale
eorum domicilium,” as a Latin document of 1369 says. This is the
historical basis of the Montenegrin claim to Scutari, where the Balsha
family remained till (in 1396) it sold that city to Venice. The rest of
Albania was occupied by native chiefs, the most famous of them being
Carlo Topia at Durazzo, who boasted his descent from the Angevins—a
fact commemorated by the French lilies on his still extant tomb near
Elbassan—and from whom Essad Pasha Toptani derived his origin.</p>

<p>Still more famous was Vukashin, guardian and cup-bearer of the
young Tsar, who drove his master from the throne in 1366, and assumed
the title of king, with the government of the specially Serbian lands and
Prizren as his capital. A later legend makes the usurper murder his
sovereign during a hunting-party on the plain of Kossovo. But it has
now been proved that Stephen Urosh V survived his supposed murderer,
who fell by the hand of his own servant, fighting against the Turks at
the battle of the Maritza in 1371—the first great blow that Serbia
received from her future conqueror. His son, Marko Kraljevich, “the
King’s son, Marko,” that great hero of South Slavonic poetry, whose
exploits were portrayed by M. Meshtrovich in the Serbian pavilion of
the Rome exhibition in 1911, retained Prilip; and it is recorded that,
when in 1912 the Serbian army attacked that place, their officers
appealed to them in the name of the national hero to liberate his
residence from the Turks. Two months after Vukashin Stephen Urosh V
died also, and Lazar Grbljanovich, a connection of the Imperial family,
ascended the throne of an Empire so diminished that he preferred the
style of “Prince” to that of Tsar, which was conferred upon him in the
ballads. Serbia was no longer the leading Slav state of the peninsula—for
the great Bosnian ruler Stephen Tvrtko I (1353-91) had won the
hegemony of the Southern Slavs, and in 1376 had himself crowned on
the grave of St Sava at Mileshevo as “King of the Serbs, and of Bosnia,
and of the coast.” To secure the latter, he founded the present fortress
of Castelnuovo at the entrance of the Bocche di Cattaro; and in 1385
Cattaro itself was his.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the nation destined to destroy both the Serbian and the
Bosnian Kingdoms was rapidly advancing. The Turks took Nish in 1386,
and in 1389 Lazar set out, attended by all his paladins, from his capital
of Krushevatz—for the Serbian royal residence had receded within the
limits of Danubian Serbia—to do battle with Murad I on the fatal field
of Kossovo.</p>

<p>A Serbian ballad tells how on the eve of the battle the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
Elijah in the guise of a falcon flew with a letter from the Virgin into
Lazar’s tent, offering him the choice between the Empire of this world
and the Heavenly kingdom, and how he chose the latter. The armies met
on St Vitus’ day, June 15 (<span class="allsmcap">O.S.</span>), 1389. Seven nationalities composed that
of the Christians; at least one Christian vassal helped to swell the smaller
forces of the Turks. While Murad was arraying himself for the fight, a
noble Serb, Milosh Kobilich<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>, presented himself as a deserter and begged
to have speech of the Sultan. His request was granted, he entered the
royal tent, and stabbed Murad to the heart, paying with his own life
for this act, but gaining thereby immortality in Serbian poetry. None
the less, the Turks went undismayed into battle. At first, the Bosniaks
drove back one Turkish wing; but Bayezid I, the young Sultan, held his
own on the other, and threw the Christians into disorder. A rumour of
treachery increased their confusion; whether truly or no, it is still the
popular tradition that Vuk Brankovich, Lazar’s son-in-law, betrayed
the Serbian cause at Kossovo. Lazar was taken prisoner, and slain in the
tent where the dying Murad lay, and with him fell the Serbian Empire.</p>

<p>At first Christendom believed that the Turks had been defeated.
A <i>Te Deum</i> was sung in Paris to the God of battles; Florence wrote to
congratulate the Bosnian king, Tvrtko, on the supposed victory. But
Lazar’s widow, Militza, as a ballad beautifully tells the tale, soon learnt
the truth in her “white palace” at Krushevatz from the crows that had
hovered over the battlefield. The name of Kossovo is remembered
throughout the Serbian lands, as if it had been fought but yesterday.
Every year the anniversary is kept, in 1916, for the first time in England;
and it was the fact that the late Archduke Franz Ferdinand chose this
day of all days to make his entry into Sarajevo, which perhaps contributed
to his assassination. Although the battle of Kumanovo in 1912
avenged Kossovo, yet the Montenegrins still wear a black band on their
caps in sign of mourning for it; in many a lonely village the minstrel
sings to the sound of the <i>gusle</i> the melancholy legend of Kossovo. On
the field itself Murad’s heart is still preserved, while the Hungarian Serbs
treasure in the monastery of Vrdnik the shroud of Lazar.</p>

<p>A diminished Serbian principality lingered on for another seventy
years. Bayezid recognised the late ruler’s eldest son, Stephen Lazarevich,
with the title of “Prince” (exchanged in 1404 for that of “Despot,”
thenceforth borne by the Serbian princes) on condition that he paid
tribute and came every year with a contingent to join the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
troops, and gave him the hand of his youngest sister; while Vuk
Brankovich received the reward of his treachery by holding the old
capital of Prishtina as a vassal of the Sultan. For a time the Turkish
defeat at Angora by the Tartars in 1402 enabled the Serbian Despot
to play off one Turkish pretender against another, while he purchased
domestic peace by making Brankovich’s son George his heir. Thus he
could devote himself to organising his country and patronising literature
in the person of Constantine “the Philosopher,” who repaid his hospitality
by writing his biography. He appointed a species of Cabinet, with which
he discussed affairs of state, founded the monastery of Manassia,
obtained Belgrade by diplomacy from the Hungarians, fortified it and
adorned it with churches. In his time Venice began her colonies in
Albania and what is now Montenegro—at Durazzo in 1392, Alessio in
1393, Drivasto and Scutari in 1396, Antivari and Dulcigno in 1421 (the
former, however, not definitely till 1444), while in 1420 Cattaro placed
herself under the protection of the Lion of St Mark, then master of most
of the Dalmatian coast, save where the Ragusan Republic formed an
enclave in his territory.</p>

<p>Serbia under George Brankovich, who succeeded as “Despot” in
1427, was thus practically a Danubian principality. The new Despot,
a man of sixty years, was an experienced diplomatist; but there are
times in the Balkans when force is more valuable than the subtlest
diplomacy. A warlike Sultan, in the person of Murad II, sat on the
Turkish throne; and he soon showed his intentions by demanding the
whole of Serbia, and invading that country. Brankovich had to move
his capital from Krushevatz to the bank of the Danube, where at
Semendria he built the fine castle with the red brick cross in its walls
which is still a memorial of Serbia’s past, while in order to secure himself
an eventual refuge in Hungary, he handed over Belgrade to the Hungarian
monarch, notwithstanding the protests and tears of its citizens. Brankovich
in vain tried to purchase peace by giving his daughter with a regal
outfit to the Sultan. Ere long, however, the Sultan, incited by a fanatic
who accused him of sinning against Allah by allowing the Serbian
unbeliever to bar the way to Hungary and Italy, demanded the surrender
of Semendria. Brankovich fled to Hungary, thence to his last maritime
possessions of Antivari and Budua, and thence to Ragusa; but the
victories of John Hunyady, “the white knight of Wallachia,” induced
Murad in 1444 to restore to the Despot the whole of Serbia, on
payment of half its annual revenue.</p>

<p>Brankovich by his “enlightened egoism” managed to maintain a
precarious autonomy till after the capture of Constantinople (1453).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
Then, Mohammed II resolved to end what remained of Serbian independence,
and to capture the famous silver mines of Novo Brdo, which,
as his biographer, Kritoboulos, remarked, had not only largely contributed
to the splendour of the Serbian Empire, but had also aroused the
covetousness of its enemies. Indeed, the picture which the Imbrian
writer draws of Serbia on the eve of the Turkish conquest is almost
idyllic, with her “cities many and fair,” her “strong forts on the Danube,”
her “productive soil, swine and cattle, and abundant breed of goodly
steeds.” But the flower of the Serbian youth had been drafted into the
corps of Janissaries to fight against their fellow-Christians, the prince
was a man of ninety and a fugitive, while Mohammed, like the Germans
of to-day, had marvellous artillery. Still Belgrade, then a Hungarian
fortress, resisted, thanks to the skill of Hunyady and the fiery eloquence
of the Franciscan Capistrano. But the nonagenarian Despot was
wounded in a quarrel with the Hungarian governor, and on Christmas-eve,
1456, died. Of his sons the two elder had been blinded by the late
Sultan, so that his third son, Lazar III, succeeded him. His speedy
death resulted, at this eleventh hour of Serbian history, in the union
of both Serbia and Bosnia by the marriage of one of his daughters with
the Bosnian Crown Prince, Stephen Tomashevich—an arrangement
which even Dushan, in all his glory, had never achieved. The Bosnian
Despot of Serbia took up his abode at Semendria; but the inhabitants,
regarding their new master with disfavour, as a Catholic and
a Hungarian nominee, opened their gates to the Turks; before the
summer of 1459 was over, all Serbia had become a Turkish pashalik,
except Belgrade, which remained a Hungarian fortress till 1521. Four
years after the fall of Serbia her last Despot, then King of Bosnia,
was beheaded at Jajce, and his kingdom annexed by the Turks.
Twenty years after Bosnia, the Duchy of St Sava, the modern
Herzegovina, met with the same fate.</p>

<p>Thus the history of mediæval Serbia was closed. But members of
the Brankovich family continued to bear the title of Despot in their
Hungarian exile, whither many of their adherents had followed them,
till the extinction of their house two centuries ago; the Serbian Patriarchate,
abolished in 1459, but revived by the Turks in 1557, existed
till 1767; but from the time of Mohammed II to that of Black George
in 1804, when Danubian Serbia rose from her long enslavement, the
noblest representatives of the Serbs maintained their freedom in the
Republics of Ragusa, “the South Slavonic Athens,” and Poljitza, “the
South Slavonic San Marino,” and among the barren rocks of free
Montenegro.</p>

<h4 id="heading24">APPENDIX<br />
THE FOUNDER OF MONTENEGRO</h4>

<p>The parentage of Stephen Crnojevich, the founder of the like-named
Montenegrin dynasty, has hitherto rested merely on conjecture. The
two oldest writers on South Slavonic history, Orbini<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> and Luccari<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>,
identified him with Stefano Maramonte, an adventurer from Apulia,
who is known from Venetian sources<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> to have been a totally different
person. Subsequent writers, such as Ducange<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>, Fallmerayer<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>, Milakovich<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>,
and Lenormant<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>, have usually adopted without question this identification;
while the first native historian of Montenegro, the <i>Vladika</i> Vasilj
Petrovich<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>, made him the son of a certain John Crnojevich, who was
descended from the Serbian royal family of Nemanja. According to
these respective theories, he first appeared in Montenegrin history in
1419, 1421 or 1423. Hopf<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>, and Count de Mas Latrie<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>, who were far
nearer the truth, asserted him to have been a son of Raditch Crnoje,
who is described as “lord of the Zeta and Budua and of the other parts of
Slavonia” in 1392, as “baron of the parts of the Zeta” in 1393, and as
having fallen in battle in 1396, after having been a “very powerful
man” and an honorary citizen of Venice<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span></p>

<p>The Venetian documents, published by Ljubich, prove beyond all
doubt that Stephen Crnojevich was the son of George Jurash, or
Jurashevich—a name first mentioned<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> in a Ragusan document of 1403.
Three years later George Jurashevich and his brother Alexius dominated
the Upper Zeta; in 1420 they were “barons of the Zeta” and were
promised the possession of Budua<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>—the very same places that Raditch
Crnoje had held. These facts might have suggested that they were his
next-of-kin, not, as Hopf<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> and Miklosich<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> supposed, members of a
distinct clan. The identity of the two families is proved by a document<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
of 1426, which mentions for the first time <i>Stefaniza fiol del Zorzi Juras</i>,
while subsequent documents prove conclusively that this Stefaniza was
none other than Stephen Crnojevich. He had three brothers, one “lately
dead” in 1443, and in the next year mention is made of the three
survivors as <i>Jurassin, Stefanice, et Coicini, fratrum de Zernoievich</i><a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>.</p>

<p>The exact relationship of Stephen’s father, George Jurashevich, to
Raditch Crnoje can only be surmised. We know however that Raditch
had several brothers<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>; if we assume that one was called George, or
Jurash, this man’s son would then be called Jurashevich; thus Stephen
would be Raditch’s grand-nephew—a degree of relationship which would
correspond with his death<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> in 1466, two generations after that of his
great-uncle. As the legitimate heirs of Raditch, the Jurashevich naturally
reverted to the more distinguished surname of Crnojevich, a name found
in that region in 1351, while Crnagora, the Serb name for Montenegro,
occurs in a Ragusan document<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> of 1362. There is a tradition<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> that the
family came originally from Zajablje in the Herzegovina.</p>

<h3 id="heading25">3. BOSNIA BEFORE THE TURKISH CONQUEST<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></h3>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The History of Bosnia down to 1180.</span></h4>

<p>The earliest known inhabitants of Bosnia and the Herzegovina
belonged to that Illyrian stock which peopled the western side of the
Balkan peninsula at the close of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> At that period
we find two Illyrian tribes, the Ardiæi and the Autariatæ, in possession
of those lands. The former occupied West Bosnia, while the latter
extended to the south and gave their name to the river Tara, which
forms for some distance the present frontier between Montenegro and
the Herzegovina. Few characteristics of these remote tribes have been
preserved by the Greek and Roman writers, but we are told that the
Ardiæi were noted even among the Illyrians for their drunken habits,
and that they were the proprietors of a large body of slaves, who
performed all their manual offices for them. Of the Autariatæ we know
nothing beyond the fact of their power at that epoch.</p>

<p>But the old Illyrian inhabitants had to acknowledge the superiority
of another race. About 380 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Celts invaded the peninsula, and,
by dint of continual pushing, ousted the natives of what is now Serbia,
and so became neighbours of the Ardiæi. Their next step was to drive
the latter southward into the modern Herzegovina, and to seize their
possessions in North Bosnia. Instead of uniting against the Celtic
invaders the Illyrian tribes fell to quarrelling among themselves over
some salt springs, which were unfortunately situated at the spot where
their confines met. This fratricidal struggle had the effect of so weakening
both parties that they fell an easy prey to the common foe. The victorious
Celts pursued their southward course, and by 335 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> both Bosnia and
the Herzegovina were in their power, and the Illyrians either exiles or else
subject to the Celtic sway. This is the first instance of that fatal tendency
to disunion which has throughout been the curse of these beautiful lands.
The worst foes of Bosnia and the Herzegovina have been those of their
own household.</p>

<p>The Celtic supremacy left few traces behind it. While in the south
a powerful Illyrian state was formed, which offered a stubborn resistance
to Rome herself, the Celtic and Illyrian inhabitants of Bosnia and the
Herzegovina remained in the happy condition of having no history.
But when the South Illyrian state fell before the Romans, in 167 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
and the legionaries encamped on the river Narenta, upon which the
present Herzegovinian capital stands, the people who dwelt to the north
felt that the time had come to defend themselves. One of their tribes
had already submitted to the Romans, but the others combined in a
confederation, which had its seat at Delminium, a fortress near the
modern town of Sinj, in Dalmatia, from which the confederates took the
common name of Dalmatians. The first struggle lasted for nearly a
century, in spite of the capture and destruction of Delminium by Scipio
Nasica in 155 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and it was reserved for Caius Cosconius in 78 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to
subdue the Dalmatian confederates and bring Bosnia and the Herzegovina
for the first time beneath the Roman sway. Those lands were then
merged in the Roman province of Illyricum, which stretched from the
Adriatic to the western frontier of modern Serbia and from the Save
into North Albania. But the spirit of the brave Dalmatians was still
unbroken, and they never lost an opportunity of rising against their
Roman masters. Aided by their winter climate, they resisted the armies
of Cæsar’s most trusted lieutenants, and the Emperor Augustus was
twice wounded in his youthful campaign against them. One of their
revolts in the early years of the Christian era was, in the words of
Suetonius, “the greatest danger which had threatened Rome since the
Punic wars.” Under their chiefs Bato and Pines they defied the legions
of Tiberius for four long years, and it was only when their last stronghold
had fallen, and Bato had been taken captive, that they submitted. Their
power as an independent nation was broken for ever, their country
was laid waste, and in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 9 finally incorporated with the Roman
Empire. North Bosnia became part of the province of Pannonia; the
Herzegovina and Bosnia south of a line drawn from Novi through
Banjaluka and Doboj to Zvornik, were included in the province of
Dalmatia. The Romans divided up the latter in their usual methodical
manner into three districts, grouped round three towns, where was the
seat of justice, and whither the native chieftains came to confer with
the Roman authorities. Thus Salona, near Spalato, once a city half as
large as Constantinople, but now a heap of ruins, was made the centre
of government for South Bosnia, while the Herzegovina fell within the
jurisdiction of Narona, a fortress which has been identified with Vid,
near Metkovich.</p>

<p>The Roman domination, which lasted till the close of the fifth
century, has left a permanent mark upon the country. The interior, it
is true, never attained to such a high degree of civilisation as the more
accessible towns on the Dalmatian coast, and no such magnificent
building as the palace at Spalato in which Diocletian spent the evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
of his days adorned the inland settlements. But the conquerors
developed, much as the Austrians have done in our own time, those
natural resources which the natives had neglected. Three great Roman
roads united Salona and the sea with the principal places up country.
One of these highways skirted the beautiful lake Jezero, traversed the
now flourishing town of Banjaluka, which derives its modern name,
“the Baths of St Luke,” from the ruins of a Roman bath, and ended
at Gradishka, on the Save. Another connected Salona with the plain of
Sarajevo, even then regarded as the centre of the Bosnian trade, and
the valley of the Drina, while a branch penetrated as far as Plevlje,
in the <i>sandjak</i> of Novibazar, then a considerable Roman settlement.
The third, starting also from Salona, crossed the south of the Herzegovina,
where traces of it may still be seen. Then, too, the mineral wealth of
Bosnia was first exploited—the gold workings near the source of the
river Vrbas and the rich deposits of iron ore in the north-west. The
natives, hitherto occupied in fighting or farming, were now forced to
work at the gold diggings. Roman authors extolled the Bosnian gold,
the “Dalmatian metal” of Statius, of which as much as 50 lbs. were
obtained in a single day, and a special functionary presided at Salona
over the administration of the Bosnian gold mines. The salt springs of
Dolnja Tuzla, now a busy manufacturing town, were another source of
wealth, and the numerous coins of the Roman period discovered up and
down the country show that a considerable amount of money was in
circulation there. Many a Roman colonist must have been buried in
Bosnian soil, for numbers of tombstones with Latin inscriptions have
been found, and the national museum at Sarajevo is full of Roman
cooking utensils, Roman vases, and Roman instruments of all kinds.
Most important of all, it was during the Roman period that the first
seeds of Christianity were sown in these remote Balkan lands. The exact
date of this event, which was to exercise paramount influence for evil
as well as good upon the future history of Bosnia, is unknown, but we
may safely assume that the Archbishopric of Salona was the seat of the
new doctrine, from which it rapidly spread throughout the Dalmatian
province. Several bishoprics, which are mentioned as subordinate to
the archiepiscopal See of Salona in the sixth century, are to be found in
Bosnia, and one in particular, the bishopric of Bistue, lay in the very
heart of that country.</p>

<p>But the power of Rome on the further shore of the Adriatic and in
the mountains behind it did not long survive the break-up of the Western
Empire in 476. Bosnia and the Herzegovina experienced the fate of the
provinces of Pannonia and Dalmatia, of which they had so long formed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
a part. Twenty years earlier Marcellinus, a Roman general, had carved
out for himself an independent principality in Dalmatia, and his nephew
and successor, Julius Nepos, maintained his independence there for a
short space after the fall of the Empire. But Odoacer soon made himself
master of the old Roman province, and in 493 the Ostrogoths under
Theodoric overran the country, and for the next forty years Bosnia and
the Herzegovina owned their sway. This change of rulers made little
difference in the condition of the people. The Ostrogoths did not
interfere with the religious institutions which they found already in
existence. Under their government two ecclesiastical councils were held
at Salona, and two new bishoprics founded, bringing the total number
up to six. Theodoric, like the Romans before him, paid special attention
to the mineral wealth of Bosnia, and a letter is extant in which he
appoints an overseer of “the Dalmatian iron ore mines.” But in 535
began the twenty years’ war between the Ostrogoths and the Emperor
Justinian. These lands at once became the prey of devastating armies,
the battle-field of Gothic and Byzantine combatants. In the midst of
the general confusion a horde of new invaders appeared, probably at
the invitation of the Gothic King, and in 548 we hear of the Slavs for
the first time in the history of the country. Further Slavonic detachments
followed in the next few years, and before the second half of the
sixth century was far advanced there was a considerable Slav population
in the western part of the Balkan peninsula. Even when the war
had ended with the overthrow of the Gothic realm, and Bosnia and the
Herzegovina had fallen under the Byzantine sway, the inroads of the
Slavs did not cease. Other savage tribes came too, and the Avars in
particular were the terror of the inhabitants. This formidable race,
akin to the Huns, whom they rivalled in ferocity, soon reduced the
once flourishing province of Dalmatia to a wilderness. During one of
their marches through Bosnia they destroyed nearly forty fortified
places on the road from the Save to Salona, and finally reduced that
prosperous city to the heap of ruins which it has ever since remained,
while the citizens formed out of Diocletian’s abandoned palace the town
which bears the name of Spalato, or the Palace, to this day. But the
Avars were not to have an unchallenged supremacy over the country.
In the first half of the seventh century the Emperor Herakleios
summoned to his aid two Slavonic tribes, the Croats and Serbs, and
offered them the old Illyrian lands as his vassals if they would drive out
the Avars. Nothing loth they at once accepted the invitation, and, after
a fierce struggle, subdued the barbarians, whose hands had been as
heavy upon the Slavonic as upon the Roman settlers. The Croats, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
came somewhat earlier than the Serbs, took up their abode in what is
still known as Croatia, and in the northern part of Dalmatia, as far as
the river Cetina; the Serbs occupied the coast line from that river as
far south as the present Albanian town of Durazzo, and inland the whole
of modern Serbia (as it was before 1912), Montenegro, Bosnia, the
Herzegovina, and the <i>sandjak</i> of Novibazar. From that time onwards
these regions have, under various alien dominations, never lost their
Slavonic character, and to this day even the Bosniaks who profess the
faith of Islâm, no less than their Orthodox brothers, are of Serbian stock.</p>

<p>The history of Bosnia and the Herzegovina from this Slavonic
settlement in the first half of the seventh down to the middle of the
tenth century is very obscure. We have few facts recorded, and nothing
is gained by repeating the names of mythical rulers, whose existence
has been disproved by the researches of critical historians. But it is
possible to form some general idea of the state of the country during this
period of transition. Nominally under the suzerainty of the Byzantine
Empire, much in the same sense as modern Bulgaria was till 1908 under
that of the Sultan, Bosnia and its neighbouring lands were practically
independent and formed a loose agglomeration of small districts, each
of which was called by the Slavonic name of <i>jupa</i> and was governed by
a headman known as a <i>jupan</i>. The most important of these petty chiefs
was awarded the title of great <i>jupan</i>, and the various districts composed
a sort of primitive confederation under his auspices. Two of the districts
received names which attained considerable importance in subsequent
history. The Slavonic settlers in the valley of the Upper Bosna adapted
the Latin designation of that river, Basante, to their own idiom by
calling the stream Bosna and themselves Bosniaks, and the name of the
river was afterwards extended to the whole country, which from that
time onwards was known as Bosnia—a term first found in the form
“Bosona,” of Constantine Porphyrogenitus<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>. Similarly Mount Hum,
above the present town of Mostar, gave its name to the surrounding
district, which was called the Land of Hum, or Zahumlje, until in the
middle of the fifteenth century it was re-christened the “Land of the
Duke,” or the Herzegovina, from the German <i>Herzog</i>. These derivations
are much more probable than the alternatives recently offered, according
to which Bosnia means the “land of salt” in Albanian, and the
Herzegovina means the “land of stones” in Turkish<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>.</p>

<p>The Slavs, with the adaptability of many other conquerors, soon
accepted the religion which they found already established in these
countries. The Serbs, who settled at the mouth of the Narenta, alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
adhered to paganism, and erected on the ruins of the old Roman town
of Narona a shrine of their god Viddo, from whom the modern village
of Vid derives its name. Here heathen rites were celebrated for more
than two hundred years, and as late as the beginning of the last
century the inhabitants of Vid cherished ancient idols, of which the
original significance had long passed away.</p>

<p>The political history of Bosnia was determined for many generations
by its geographical position on the boundary line between the Croatian
and Serbian settlements. It was here that these two branches of the
Slavonic race met, and from the moment when two rival groups were
formed under Croatian and Serbian auspices Bosnia became the coveted
object of both. That country accordingly submitted to Croatian and
Serbian rulers by turns. Early in the tenth century it seems to have
acknowledged the sway of Tomislav, first King of the Croats, and was
administered as a dependency by an official known as a <i>ban</i>, the
Croatian name for a “governor,” which survived to our own day. A
little later the Serbian Prince Tchaslav incorporated it in the confederation
which he welded together, and defended it against the Magyars,
who now make their first appearance in its history. Under a chieftain
named Kés these dangerous neighbours had penetrated as far as the
upper waters of the river Drina, where the Serbian Prince inflicted a
crushing defeat upon them. But, in his zeal to carry the war into the
enemy’s country, he perished himself, and with his death his dominions
fell asunder, and Bosnia became for a brief period independent. But
Kreshimir, King of the Croats, recovered it in 968, and for the next
half-century it belonged to the Croatian crown. But about 1019 the
Emperor Basil II restored for a time the dormant Byzantine sovereignty
over the whole Balkan peninsula. After the bloody campaigns which
earned him the title of “the Bulgar-slayer” and ended in the destruction
of the first Bulgarian Empire, he turned his arms against the Serbs and
Croats, forcing the latter to receive their crown from Constantinople
and reducing Bosnia to more than nominal subjection to his throne.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Herzegovina, or the “Land of Hum,” as it was then
called, had had a considerable history of its own. Early in the tenth
century, at the time when the Croatian King Tomislav was extending
his authority over Bosnia, we hear of a certain Michael Vishevich, who
ruled over the sister land and held his court in the ancient fortress of
Blagaj, above the source of the river Buna. Vishevich was evidently
a prince of considerable importance. The Pope addressed him as “the
most excellent Duke of the people of Hum”; the Byzantine Emperor
awarded him the proud titles of “proconsul and Patrician.” The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
Republic of Ragusa paid him an annual tribute of thirty-six ducats for
the vineyards of her citizens which lay within his territory. His fleet,
starting from the seaport of Stagno, then the seat of a bishopric as well
as an important haven, ravaged the Italian coast opposite, and made the
name of “Michael, King of the Slavs,” as a chronicler styles him, a
terror to the inhabitants of Apulia. The great Bulgarian Tsar Symeon
was his ally, and on two occasions during his struggle with the Byzantine
Empire he received aid or advice from him. We find him seconding
Tomislav’s proposal for summoning the famous ecclesiastical council
which met at Spalato in 925 and prohibited the use of the Slavonic
liturgy. In short, nothing of importance occurred in that region during
his reign in which he had not his say<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>. But after his death his dominions
seem to have been included, like Bosnia, in the Serbian confederation
of Tchaslav; and, when that collapsed, they were annexed by the King
of Dioklitia, whose realm derived its name from the town of Doclea in
what is now Montenegro, and took its origin in the valley of the Zeta,
which divides that kingdom in two. About the end of the tenth century
however, the powerful Bulgarian Tsar Samuel established his supremacy
over the Kingdom of Dioklitia, and the treacherous murder of its King
a few years later completed the incorporation of Dioklitia, and consequently
of the Herzegovina, in the Bulgarian Empire. But its
connexion with Bulgaria was short-lived. When Basil “the Bulgar-slayer”
destroyed the sovereignty of the Bulgarian Tsars he added the
Herzegovina as well as Bosnia to his own domains. Thus the twin
provinces fell at the same moment beneath the Byzantine sway, and
from 1019 remained for a space parts of that Empire, governed sometimes
by imperial governors, sometimes by native princes acting as
imperial viceroys. Bosnia was the first to raise the standard of revolt,
and no sooner was the Emperor Basil II dead than it regained its
independence under <i>bans</i> of its own, who raised it to an important
position among the petty states of that time. The Herzegovina, less
fortunate, only exchanged the sovereignty of the Emperor at Constantinople
for that of the King of Dioklitia, who in 1050 made himself
master of the land. For exactly a century it remained an integral portion
of that kingdom, and had therefore no separate history. Even Bosnia
succumbed a generation later to the monarchs of Dioklitia, for about
1085 all the three neighbouring lands, Serbia, Bosnia and the Herzegovina,
had to accept governors from King Bodin of the Zeta, and thus
a great Serb state existed under his sceptre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span></p>

<p>But in the early years of the twelfth century a new force made itself
felt in South Slavonic lands, a force which even in our own day has till
lately exercised a powerful influence over the fortunes of the Balkan
peninsula. Since their unsuccessful incursion in the time of Tchaslav
the Hungarians had never abandoned their cherished object of gaining
a foothold there. But it was not till the union of Croatia in 1102, and of
Dalmatia in 1105, with the Hungarian Crown by Koloman, that this
object was attained. The Hungarian Kings thus came into close contact
with Bosnia, and were not long in extending their authority over that
country. So far from meeting with opposition they were regarded by
the people as valuable allies in the common struggle against the Byzantine
Emperors of the family of the Comnenoi, who aimed at restoring the past
glories and dimensions of their realm. Accordingly in 1135 we find an
Hungarian King, Béla II, for the first time styling himself “King of
Rama”—the name of a river in Bosnia, which Magyar chroniclers
applied first to the surrounding district and then to the whole country.
From that time onward, whoever the actual possessors of Rama, or
Bosnia, might be, it was always included among the titles of the
Hungarian monarchs, and, till our own time, the Emperor Francis
Joseph in his capacity of King of Hungary called himself also “King of
Rama.” In his case the phrase had certainly a more practical significance
than it possessed in earlier centuries.</p>

<p>The precise manner in which this close connexion between Hungary
and Bosnia was formed is obscure. According to one theory Béla
received the country as the dowry of his Serbian wife; according to
another the Bosnian magnates, seeing the increasing power of Hungary
and the revived pretensions of the Byzantine Emperors, decided to seek
the protection of the former against the latter. At any rate a little later
Béla assigned Bosnia as a duchy to his second son, Ladislaus, leaving,
however, the actual government of that land in the hands of native <i>bans</i>.
It is now that we hear the name of one of these rulers for the first time.
Hitherto the Bosnian governors have been mere shadowy figures,
flitting unrecognised and almost unnoticed across the stage of history.
But <i>ban</i> Borich, who now comes into view, is a man of flesh and blood.
In the wars between the Emperor Manuel Comnenos and the Hungarians
he was the staunch ally of the latter, and when a disputed succession
to the Hungarian throne took place he aspired to play the part of a
king-maker and supported the claims of Ladislaus, the titular “duke”
of Bosnia. But he made the mistake of choosing the losing side and,
after being conquered by the troops of the successful candidate, disappeared
mysteriously in 1163. Short, however, as was his career, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
had extended the eastern borders of Bosnia to the river Drina, and we
learn from the contemporary Greek historian Cinnamus<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> that his
country was “independent of Serbia and governed in its own fashion.”
Three years after his disappearance from the scene Bosnia shared the
fate of Croatia and Dalmatia, and fell into the hands of Manuel
Comnenos. But upon the death of that powerful Emperor in 1180 the
fabric which he had laboriously erected collapsed; the Balkan peoples
had nothing more to fear from the Byzantine Empire, and Bosnia under
her famous <i>ban</i> Kulin attained to greater freedom and prosperity than
she had yet enjoyed. But the same period which witnessed this political
and material progress witnessed also the development of that ecclesiastical
schism which was one day destined to cause the loss of all freedom and
the suspension of all progress by facilitating the Turkish conquest of
the land.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Great Bosnian Bans (1180-1376).</span></h4>

<p>Kulin is the first great figure in Bosnian history. By nature a man
of peace, he devoted his attention to the organisation of the country,
which in his time was a ten days’ journey in circumference, the development
of its commerce, and the maintenance of its independence. He
allowed foreigners ready access to his dominions, employed two Italian
painters and goldsmiths at his court, and gave liberal mining concessions
to two shrewd burghers of Ragusa, which during the middle ages was
the chief emporium of the inland trade. He concluded in 1189 a treaty
of commerce with that city—the earliest known Bosnian document—in
which he swore to be its “true friend now and for ever, and to keep
true peace and genuine troth” with it all his life. Ragusan merchants
were permitted to settle wherever they chose in his territory, and no
harm was to be done them by his officials. Agriculture flourished under
his rule, and years afterwards, whenever the Bosnian farmer had a
particularly prosperous year, he would say to his fellows, “The times
of Kulin are coming back again.” Even to-day the people regard him
as a favourite of the fairies, and his reign as a golden age, and to “talk
of <i>ban</i> Kulin” is a popular expression for one who speaks of the remote
past, when the Bosnian plum-trees always groaned with fruit and the
yellow corn-fields never ceased to wave in the fertile plains. Kulin’s
position was strengthened too by his powerful connections; for his sister
was the wife of Miroslav, Prince of the Herzegovina, which, as we have
seen, had formed part of the Kingdom of Dioklitia down to 1150, when
it was conquered by the Serbian great <i>jupan</i>, Desa. Some twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
later Stephen Nemanja made his brother Miroslav its prince, and thus
was closely connected with Kulin. The latter, like Nemanja in Serbia,
threw off all ties of allegiance to the Byzantine Empire on the death of
Manuel Comnenos, and at the same time ignored the previous relations
which had existed between the Kings of Hungary and the Bosnian <i>bans</i>.</p>

<p>But it was Kulin’s ecclesiastical policy which rendered his reign most
memorable in the after history of Bosnia. In the tenth century there
had appeared in Bulgaria a priest named “Bogomil,” or the “Beloved
of God,” who preached a mystical doctrine, peculiarly attractive to the
intellect of a Slavonic race. From the assumption that there existed in
the universe a bad as well as a good deity the Bogomiles, as his
disciples were called, deduced a complete system of theology, which
explained all phenomena to their own satisfaction. But the Bogomiles
did not content themselves with metaphysics alone. They descended
from the serene atmosphere of abstract reasoning to the questions of
ritual and the customs of society. Appropriating to themselves the title
of “good Christians,” they regarded the monks as little short of idolators,
set at naught the authority of bishops, and defied the thunders of the
popes. Their worship was characterised by extreme simplicity and often
conducted in the open air, while in their lives they aimed at a plain and
primitive ideal. A “perfect” Bogomile, one who belonged to the
strictest of the two castes into which they were divided, looked upon
marriage as impure and bloodshed as a deadly sin; he despised riches,
and owned allegiance to no one save God alone, while he had the
quaker’s objection to an oath. No wonder that popes, trembling for
their authority, branded them as heretics and pursued them with all the
horrors of fire and sword; no wonder that potentates found them
sometimes intractable subjects, and sometimes useful allies in a struggle
against ecclesiastical pretensions.</p>

<p>The Bogomiles appear to have entered Bosnia about the middle of
the twelfth century, and speedily gained a hold upon the country.
Kulin at first remained uninfluenced by their teachings. Thus, in 1180,
we find the papal legate writing to him in the most courteous terms,
and addressing him as the “noble and powerful man, the great <i>ban</i> of
Bosnia.” The legate sends him a letter and the Holy Father’s blessing,
and begs him to give him in return, as a token of his devotion, “two
servants and marten skins.” But Kulin found it politic later on to
secede from the Roman Church. For some time past the rival Archbishoprics
of Spalato and Ragusa had striven for ecclesiastical supremacy
over Bosnia. Béla III, King of Hungary, who had now time to devote
to his ambitious schemes against that country, warmly supported the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
claims of the See of Spalato, to which he had appointed a creature of
his own. Kulin was naturally on the side of Ragusa, and was encouraged
by his sister, whose late husband, Miroslav, Prince of the Herzegovina,
had had a similar contest with the Archbishop of Spalato, and had
concluded a treaty with the Ragusans. The Pope took the part of
Spalato, and Kulin retorted by defying him, as Miroslav had done before.
The latter had probably been a Bogomile for some time before his death;
the former now formally abandoned the Roman Church, with his wife,
his sister, his whole family, and ten thousand of his subjects. The force
of so potent an example was at once felt. The Bogomile or Patarene
heresy, as it was called by the Bosniaks of other creeds, now spread
apace, not only over Bosnia, but in the neighbouring lands. The two
Italian painters, whom we have mentioned as residing at Kulin’s court,
carried it to Spalato, where it extended to the other Dalmatian coast
towns; and the destruction of Zara by the crusaders in 1202 was
regarded by pious chroniclers as a judgment upon that city for its
heretical opinions.</p>

<p>King Béla III was not slow to make Kulin’s defection the excuse
for posing as defender of the true faith. But his death and the quarrels
between his heirs gave Kulin a little breathing space, and it was not
till 1200 that he was in actual danger. By that time Béla’s sons,
Emerich and Andrew, had established themselves respectively as King
of Hungary and Duke of the Herzegovina, and accordingly threatened
Bosnia from two sides. Emerich, following his father’s policy, endeavoured
to induce the Pope to preach a crusade against the Bosnian
heretics, and Innocent III, who then occupied the chair of St Peter,
hailed the King of Hungary as overlord of Bosnia, and bade him
summon Kulin to recant, or if the latter remained obdurate invade
Bosnia and occupy it himself. Thus menaced by a combination of the
spiritual and the temporal power, Kulin bowed before the storm. He
felt that at all costs Hungarian intervention must be avoided, so he
made the rather lame excuse that he had “regarded the Patarenes not
as heretics, but as Catholics,” and begged the Pope to send him some
safe adviser, who should guide his erring feet into the right way.
Innocent, pleased at Kulin’s submission, sent two ecclesiastics to Bosnia
to inquire into the religious condition of the country and to bring back
its ruler to the true fold. The mission was temporarily successful. Early
in the spring of 1203 the <i>ban</i>, his great nobles, and the heads of the
Bogomile community met in solemn assembly in the “white plain,” or
Bjelopolje, on the river Bosna, confessed their errors, and drew up a
formal document embodying their recantation. “We renounce the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
schism of which we are accused”—so runs the deed—“we promise to
have altars and crosses in all our churches, to receive the sacrament
seven times a year, to observe the fasts ordained by the church, and
to keep the festivals of the saints. Henceforth we will no more call
ourselves ‘Christians,’ but ‘brothers,’ so as not to cast a slur upon other
Christians.” The oath thus taken was renewed by representatives of the
Bogomiles in the presence of the King of Hungary, who bade Kulin
observe his promises for the future. The cloud had passed away, but
with its disappearance Kulin too disappears from the scene. An
inscription, said to be the oldest in the country and ascribed to the year
1203-04, which was found in 1898 at Muhashinovichi, on the river
Bosna, refers to a church erected by him to prove the sincerity of
his re-conversion, and prays God to grant health to him and his wife,
Voyslava. We hear no more of him after 1204; but his memory was not
soon forgotten<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>. Two centuries later a Bosnian King desired to have
confirmed to him all the “customs, usages, privileges and frontiers,
which existed in the time of Kulin,” and the rich Bosnian family of
Kulenovich of our own time (whose ancestral castle of Jaskopolje may
be seen near Jajce, almost on the spot where, in 1878, the great fight
between the Austrians and the insurgents took place) is said to derive
its name and lineage from him.</p>

<p>But the recantation of Kulin did not check the growth of the
Bogomile heresy. Under his successor, Stephen, the numbers of the
sect increased, and the efforts of Pope Honorius III and his legate to
preach a crusade against the heretics remained fruitless. The Holy Father
might exclaim that “the unbelievers in Bosnia, just as witches in a cave
nourish their offspring with their bare breasts, publicly preach their
abominable errors, to the great harm of the Lord’s flock”; but even
this mixture of metaphors failed to stimulate the flagging zeal of the
Hungarian Catholics. Even when the King of Hungary had pacified
his rebellious nobles by the golden bull, and was therefore able to turn
his attention to Bosnian affairs, the proposed crusade fell flat. The King
worked upon the cupidity of the Archbishop of Kalocsa by granting him
spiritual authority over Bosnia; but the only result was to stiffen the
backs of the recalcitrant Bosniaks. Imitating their neighbours in the
Herzegovina, who had lately made a Bogomile their Prince, they deposed
the weak-kneed Stephen and put Matthew Ninoslav, a Bogomile by
birth and education, in his place. The new <i>ban</i> proved, however, more
pliant than his poorer subjects. Alarmed at the threatening attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
of the King of Hungary, he recanted, as Kulin had done before him, and
placed his country under the protection of St Peter. But the conversion
of their Prince had little effect upon the masses. The monks of the
Dominican order might boast that they had converted, if not convinced,
Ninoslav, but it was felt that stronger measures must be taken against
his people. In 1234 a crusade was at last organised, and for the next five
years the Bogomiles of Bosnia experienced all those horrors of fire and
sword which their fellows, the Albigenses, had suffered in the south of
France. Under different names and in widely different spheres the two
bodies of heretics had adopted similar doctrines. Indeed, the Albigenses
had looked to the Bogomile “pope,” or primate, of Bosnia for spiritual
instruction and advice, and accepted their “vicar” at his hands. But
while historians and poets of renown have cast lustre upon the struggles
and sufferings of the martyrs of Provence the probably equally heroic
resistance of the Bosnian Bogomiles has made little impression upon
literature. Yet it is clear that they possessed all the stubborn valour
of our own puritans. In spite of the conquest of both Bosnia and the
Herzegovina in 1237 by the Hungarian King’s son, Koloman, who
received the former country from the King and the Pope as the reward
of his labours, in spite of the erection of forts and a Catholic Cathedral
to keep the unruly passions and heretical inclinations of the people in
order, the spirit of the Bogomiles remained unbroken. Ninoslav, furious
at the arbitrary substitution of Koloman for himself, once more
appeared as their champion, and the great defeat of the Hungarians
by the Tartars in 1241 not only rid him of his rival, Koloman, but freed
his land from all fear of Hungarian intervention for some time to come.
Even the incursion of the Tartars into Bosnia was a small disadvantage
as compared with the benefits which that country had derived from their
previous victory over its foes. Ninoslav now felt himself strong enough
to assist Spalato in its struggle against the King of Hungary and to
offer an alliance to Ragusa against the growing power of the Serbian
monarchy. A second crusade in Bosnia in 1246 was not more successful
than the first, and the Pope in placing the Bosnian See under the
authority of the Archbishop of Kalocsa, expressly gave as his reason
“the utter hopelessness of a voluntary conversion of that country to
the true faith.” Even the papal permission to use the Slavonic tongue
and the Glagolitic characters in the Catholic service did not win over
the Bogomiles to Rome. Crusades and concessions had alike failed<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span></p>

<p>Ninoslav passes out of sight in 1250, and the next two generations
are, with the exception of the Turkish supremacy, the gloomiest period
of Bosnian history. Religious differences and a disputed succession
made the country an easy prey to the ambitious designs of the Hungarian
monarchs, who, after a brief support of Ninoslav’s relative, the Catholic
Prijesda I, in 1254 subdued not only Bosnia but the Herzegovina
beneath their sway. While the latter about 1284 fell under Serbian
influence the former was split up into two parts. The Upper, or hill-country,
Bosnia properly so-called, was allowed to retain native <i>bans</i>—Prijesda
I and his sons<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>, Prijesda II and Stephen Kotroman, till 1302;
Lower Bosnia, <i>i.e.</i> the “salt” district of Soli (the modern Tuzla) with
Usora, for the sake of greater security, was at first entrusted to
Hungarian magnates, and then combined with a large slice of northern
Serbia, known as Matchva, in a compact duchy, which was conferred
upon near relatives of the Hungarian King. During this period the
history of this distracted land is practically a blank. Beyond the names
of its successive rulers we have little handed down to us by the
chroniclers. “A sleep as of death,” in the words of a Croatian writer,
“had fallen upon the country. The whole national and religious life of
Bosnia had perished beneath the cold blasts of the wind from beyond the
Save.” Now and again we come upon traces of the old Bogomile spirit
and the old zeal of the persecutors. Stephen Dragutin, who had been
driven by lameness from the Serbian throne and had become under
Hungarian auspices Duke of Matchva and Bosnia in 1284, was specially
noted for his “conversion and baptism of many heretics,” and it was in
answer to his request that the Franciscans, who have since played such
an important part in Bosnian history, settled in the country. But still
the Pope complained that “the churches were deserted and the priesthood
uprooted.” Meanwhile two powerful families began to make their
influence felt, the Croatian clan of Shubich and the race of Kotromanich,
whose legendary founder (according to Orbini), a German knight, had
entered Bosnia in the Hungarian service and was the ancestor of the
Bosnian Kings. We now know, however, from a document of the great
Tvrtko<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>, quoted by Pope Gregory XI, that Tvrtko’s uncle, Stephen
Kotromanich, was grandson of “the great” Prijesda I. The latest
authority on the subject<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> accordingly believed the Kotroman family to
have sprung from Upper Bosnia and to have been very probably related
to Borich and Kulin. The legend of its German, or Gothic, origin arose
out of its matrimonial connections with great families of Central Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
The family of Shubich was at first in the ascendant, and became lords
of part and then the whole of the land. In fact Paul Shubich, in 1299,
styled himself “lord of Bosnia” and early in the fourteenth century
his son, Mladen, ruled, under the title of “<i>ban</i> of the Croats and all
Bosnia,” a vast tract of territory extending from the Save to the Narenta
and from the Drina to the Adriatic. But in 1322 he fell before a combination
of rivals, and young Stephen Kotromanich, who had been his deputy
in Bosnia, became independent and united both Upper and Lower
Bosnia under his sway<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>.</p>

<p>Stephen Kotromanich proved himself to be the ablest ruler whom
Bosnia had had since Kulin, and laid the foundations upon which his
successor built up the Bosnian kingdom. His reign of over thirty
years was marked by a series of successes. He began in 1325 by
annexing the Herzegovina, which, as we have seen, had been under
Serbian authority for the last two generations, as well as the sea-coast
from the river Cetina as far south as the gates of Ragusa. Thus, for the
first time in its history, Bosnia had gained an outlet on the sea, and was
not entirely dependent upon foreigners for its imports. The Dalmatian
coast with its fine harbours is the natural frontage of the country
behind, which even under the Austrians touched the sea at only two
small points. But in the first half of the fourteenth century Bosnia had
gained a considerable coast-line. Kotromanich even coveted the islands
as well, and specially Curzola, then under the overlordship of Venice.
But here his plans failed, although the Ragusans were ready to lend him
ships for the purpose. He rewarded them by confirming all their old
trading rights in his country and granting them some territorial concessions
near the mouth of the Narenta. He took an active, if somewhat
insidious, part in the operations which King Charles Robert of Hungary
and his successor, Louis the Great, conducted for the restoration of their
authority in Croatia and Dalmatia. Charles Robert, who had bestowed
upon Kotromanich a relative of his own wife in marriage, found him
a useful ally; but in the war between Louis the Great and the Venetians
for the possession of Zara the Bosnian ruler was desirous of standing
well with both sides. At the famous siege of Zara in 1345 and the
following year he went, at the bidding of Louis, to rescue the town from
its Venetian besiegers. But the crafty Venetians knew their man. They
gave him a heavy bribe, and offered him a much heavier one if he would
persuade Louis to abandon the relief of the beleaguered city. The money
was well spent. At a critical moment of the siege, when it had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
arranged that the Hungarian and Bosnian army should support the
besieged in a sally from the gates, Kotromanich and his Bosniaks hung
back and the Venetians won the day. The quaint chronicle of this
famous siege expressly ascribes the defeat of the allies to the perfidy of
“that child of Belial, Stephen, <i>ban</i> of Bosnia,” and it was largely owing
to his subsequent mediation that Zara ultimately surrendered to Venice.
But Kotromanich soon found that he required the good offices of Venice
himself. While he had been engaged in the west of the Balkan peninsula
there had grown up in the east under the mighty auspices of Stephen
Dushan the great Serbian Empire, which threatened at one moment to
swallow up Constantinople itself. Dushan is the greatest name in the
whole history of the peninsula, a name cherished to this day by every
patriotic Serb. But just as the restoration of Dushan’s Empire, the
daydream of Serbian enthusiasts, jeopardised the existence of Austrian
Bosnia, so the conquests of the great Serbian Tsar alarmed the Bosnian
ruler of that day. For the first half of his reign Dushan was too much
occupied with his eastern conquests and his law reforms to interfere
with his western neighbour. But he had not forgotten that the
Herzegovina, which Kotromanich had annexed, had once belonged to
the Serbian monarchy, and, as soon as he had leisure, he pressed his
claims. Both parties accepted the mediation of Venice, and for a time
peace was preserved. But in 1349 Kotromanich assumed the offensive,
invaded Dushan’s dominions, and penetrated as far south as the
beautiful town of Cattaro, at that time part of the Serbian Empire and
now at last restored to its natural owners, the Southern Slavs. Dushan
retaliated next year by descending upon Bosnia and laying siege to the
strong castle of Bobovatz, the residence of many Bosnian rulers. As has
usually happened in the history of the country, the persecuted Bogomiles
flocked to the standard of the invader, and Bosnia seemed to be at his
feet. But the walls of Bobovatz, behind which lay the lovely daughter
of the <i>ban</i>, whom Dushan had demanded in marriage for his son,
resisted his attacks, and he marched away southward through the
Herzegovina to Cattaro. Next year the hostilities ceased, and as a
further security Kotromanich found a husband for his daughter in
King Louis the Great of Hungary, his old ally.</p>

<p>The internal condition of Bosnia was less fortunate, however, in the
hands of Kotromanich than its external relations. The power of the
Bogomiles had greatly increased before his accession; they had a
complete organisation—a spiritual head called <i>djed</i>, or “grandfather,”
with a seat at Janjichi, and twelve “teachers” under him—while there
was not a single Catholic bishop living in the country. Moreover the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
rival orders of Dominicans and Franciscans had begun to fight for the
exclusive privilege of applying the tortures of the Inquisition to the
Bosnian heretics—a conflict which naturally favoured the growth of
that heresy. Under these circumstances Kotromanich began his reign
by openly favouring the Bogomiles, who formed the bulk of his armies
and were his best bulwark against foreign aggression so long as he was
their protector. But in 1340, on the persuasion of the King of Hungary,
he committed the political blunder of embracing the Catholic faith and
thus making his Bogomile subjects look upon Stephen Dushan as their
legitimate champion. The evil results of his ecclesiastical policy were
apparent when the great Serbian Tsar invaded his dominions.</p>

<p>Stephen Kotromanich, whose memory is preserved by his seal, the
earliest Bosnian coins and seven documents issued in his name<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>, died
in 1353, and his nephew Tvrtko succeeded him. Tvrtko is the greatest
name in Bosnian history, and his long reign of nearly forty years, first
as <i>ban</i> and then as first King of Bosnia, marks the zenith of that country’s
power. Beginning his career under circumstances of great difficulty, and
even driven at one moment from his throne, he lived to make himself
King not merely of Bosnia, but of Serbia, Croatia and Dalmatia as well,
and to unite beneath his sceptre a vast agglomeration of territory, such
as no other Bosnian ruler has ever governed.</p>

<p>The first seventeen years of his reign were spent in a desperate but
successful struggle for the mastery of his own house. He was a mere boy
at the death of his uncle, and his mother, who acted as regent, was too
weak to cope with the disorders of the time. The magnates, many of
whom were zealous Bogomiles, were contemptuous of one who was both
a child and a Catholic, while they would have welcomed the great Serbian
Tsar Dushan, had he found time to repeat his invasion of Bosnia. But
the death of that monarch on his way to the siege of Constantinople in
1355 broke up the Serbian Empire for ever and removed all fear of a
Serbian occupation of Bosnia. But with the removal of this danger
another arose. Louis the Great of Hungary had welcomed the growth
and independence of Bosnia so long as the Serbian Empire existed as a
menace to his own dominions; but, as soon as that Empire fell, he
revived the ambitious designs of his predecessors upon the Bosnian
realm. As the son-in-law of the late <i>ban</i> he had some claims to the
succession, and accordingly set to work to humiliate Tvrtko and reduce
him to a position of dependence upon the Hungarian crown. He
compelled him to surrender the Herzegovina, as far as the Narenta, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
the dowry of the Hungarian queen, and to take a solemn oath that he
would persecute the Bogomiles, that he would support Hungary in war,
and that either he or his younger brother Stephen Vuk would always
reside at the Hungarian court. In return he allowed him to remain
Bosnian <i>ban</i>—a mere puppet without power. But the crafty Louis, in
his desire to be absolute master of Bosnia overreached himself. Determined
to be doubly sure of his vassal, he incited the Bosnian magnates
to revolt against their chief. But those proud nobles, who had never
regarded their <i>ban</i> as anything more than the first of their order, had
no intention of exchanging his easy sway for the iron hand of the
Hungarian King. Louis saw his mistake, and supported Tvrtko against
the barons and the Bogomiles. But the rebels would not recognise the
authority of one who relied upon Hungarian swords to enforce it. Aided
by his brother they deposed and drove out Tvrtko in 1365, and it cost
him a desperate struggle to recover his power. Bosnia was given up to all
the horrors of civil war, and, to crown all, a terrible conflagration, the like
of which had never been seen before, broke out and destroyed everything
that came in its way. “At that time,” writes a chronicler, “the
highest mountains, with the stones, birds, and beasts upon them, were
consumed with fire, so that the hills became plains, where new corn is
sown and many a village stands. And in these villages dwell Bogomiles,
who boast that God set these mountains ablaze for their sake.” At last
Tvrtko prevailed, and in 1370 he was undisputed master of the country
and his brother an exile.</p>

<p>Freed from all fear of Louis, whose eyes were turned northward
to Poland, and master of his rebellious barons, Tvrtko began to extend
his dominions. The decline of the Serbian Empire gave him the
opportunity which he sought. Lazar, perhaps the most unfortunate
name in Serbian history, governed a remnant of that realm, which was
threatened by dissensions from within and the Turks from without.
Tvrtko aided him against his domestic rivals and received in return
large portions of Serbian territory, including a strip of coast as far as
Cattaro and the famous castle and monastery of Mileshevo, in the
modern <i>sandjak</i> of Novibazar, where lay the remains of St Sava, the
apostle of the Serbs. In virtue of this territory, he considered himself
the legitimate successor of the Serbian monarchs, and while Lazar
contented himself with the modest title of <i>knez</i>, or “prince,” Tvrtko
had himself crowned in 1376 on the grave of St Sava at Mileshevo with
two diadems, that of Bosnia and that of Serbia. Henceforth he styled
himself “Stephen Tvrtko, King of the Serbs and of Bosnia and of the
coast.” All his successors retained the Serbian title which he could claim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
as great-grandson of Stephen Dragutin, and, like the Serbian monarchs,
invariably adopted, as Tvrtko had done, the royal name of Stephen.
Not a voice was raised against this assumption of kingly power. Ragusa,
ever anxious to be on good terms with those in authority, was the first
to recognise him as the legal successor of the Serbian sovereigns, and
promptly paid him the annual tribute which she had rendered to them
on the feast of St Demetrios, as well as a sum for trading privileges in
Bosnia. Venice followed suit and addressed him as “King of Serbia,”
and the King of Hungary was too busy to protest. Tvrtko proceeded to
live up to his new dignities. He moved his residence from Srebrenik to
Sutjeska and the strong castle of Bobovatz, the picturesque ruins of
which still testify to the past glories of the first Bosnian King. Here
Tvrtko organised a court on the Byzantine model, as the rulers of Serbia
had done before him. Rough Bosnian barons held courtly offices with
high-sounding Greek names, and privileges and honours were distributed
from the throne. Hitherto Bosnian coins had been scarce, and Ragusan,
Hungarian and Venetian pieces had fulfilled most purposes of trade.
But now money, of which excellent specimens still exist, was minted
bearing the proud title of “king” instead of that of <i>ban</i>, and displaying
a visored helmet surmounted by a crown of fleurs-de-lis with a hop
blossom above. Tvrtko took his new office very seriously as a King by
the grace of God, animated, as he once wrote, “with the wish to raise
up that which is fallen and to restore that which is destroyed<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>.”</p>

<h4>III. <span class="smcap">The Kings of Bosnia (1376-1463).</span></h4>

<p>Tvrtko’s first care was to provide himself with an heir to his kingdom,
and he chose a Bulgarian princess as his queen, by whom he had a son,
afterwards King Stephen Tvrtko II. But, not content with the dignity
and the territory which he now possessed, the Bosnian monarch aspired
to found a sea power. He had, as we have seen, already gained a long
strip of seaboard from the mouth of the Cetina up to the walls of Cattaro.
But Ragusa, with its harbour Gravosa, the gem of the whole coast, was
not, and never seemed likely to be, his. He accordingly resolved, as he
could not capture Ragusa, to found at the entrance of the lovely Bocche
di Cattaro a new station, which should become its rival and the outlet
of all the inland trade. The picturesque little town of Castelnuovo stands
on the spot to-day, a place over which for a brief period in the last
century there floated the British flag. Tvrtko next obtained from Venice
an Admiral for his future fleet, and ordered galleys to be built there.
And, amidst the confusion which followed the death of Louis the Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
of Hungary, he obtained from the little Queen Maria, as the price of his
friendship, the ancient city of Cattaro, which, after having enjoyed the
protection of the Serbian Tsars, had lately acknowledged the Hungarian
rule. The finest fiord in Southern Europe was in his hands.</p>

<p>But Tvrtko did not rest here. True to his policy of making profit
out of the misfortunes of others, he availed himself of the disturbances
which now broke out in Croatia to take the side of the Croats against
their Queen and his friend Maria. Croatia was soon in his hands, and the
Dalmatian towns began to surrender. Spalato and Traù, unable to
obtain help from Hungary, agreed to submit to him by a certain day;
but when that day arrived Tvrtko was occupied elsewhere. For on the
same day on which Spalato was to have opened its gates, June 15, 1389,
the battle of Kossovo was fought, that battle which decided for five
centuries the fate of the Balkan peninsula. In that memorable conflict,
the name of which will never be forgotten by the Southern Slavs, a
Bosnian contingent aided the Serbian army against the Turks. It was
not the first time that the Bosniaks had faced their future masters in
battle. Two years earlier they had helped Prince Lazar to rout a Turkish
force, and they hoped for the same result on the plain of Kossovo.
Tvrtko himself was not present at the fight; but his trusty lieutenant
Vlatko Hranich inflicted heavy losses on the left wing of the Turkish
host, which was commanded by the Sultan’s second son. But, according
to the traditional account, when the Serbian traitor Vuk Brankovich
rode off the field the faithful Bosniaks gave way. All was lost, and the
Turkish supremacy was assured. Tvrtko at first believed that his army
had been successful. There is extant a letter in which the city of Florence
congratulated him on the glad tidings of victory which he had sent.
“Happy the kingdom of Bosnia,” says this document, “to which it was
granted to fight so famous a fight, and happiest of all your majesty, for
whom, as the victor, the true and eternal glory of the heavenly kingdom
is appointed<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>.”</p>

<p>Even when he had discovered the terrible truth Tvrtko continued
his Dalmatian campaign instead of concentrating all his energies upon
the defence of his realm against the Turks. He used the brief respite
which they gave his land to press on with his operations in the west.
Here he was speedily successful. All the Dalmatian coast towns, except
Zara and Ragusa, surrendered to him, as well as the large islands of
Brazza, Lesina and Curzola. Overjoyed at their submission, he confirmed
the privileges which they had previously enjoyed, and treated them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
the utmost consideration. Master of Dalmatia and Croatia in all but
the name, he assumed in 1390 the title of King of those countries, just
as fourteen years earlier he had proclaimed himself King of Bosnia and
Serbia. Tvrtko had now reached the summit of his power. He had
achieved the difficult feat of uniting Serbs and Croats under one sceptre;
he had made Bosnia the centre of a great kingdom, which possessed a
frontage on the Adriatic, from the Quarnero to Cattaro, save for the
enclaves of Zara and Ragusa, which embraced the territory inland as
far as the river Drina and included part of the modern <i>sandjak</i> of
Novibazar, as well as other originally Serbian territories. The beginnings
of a sea power had been formed under his auspices, and Dalmatia in
union with Bosnia was no longer “a face without a head.” Even now
Tvrtko’s ambition was not appeased. He was anxious to conclude a
political alliance with Venice and a matrimonial alliance—for his wife
had just died—with the great house of Habsburg. But death prevented
the accomplishment of his designs. On March 23, 1391, the great Bosnian
monarch expired without even being able to secure the succession for
his son.</p>

<p>It has been the fortune of each of the various Balkan races to produce
some great man, who for a brief space has made himself the foremost
figure of the peninsula. Bulgaria can point to her mighty Tsars Symeon
and Samuel, Serbia cherishes the memory of Stephen Dushan, the
Albanians have found a national hero in Skanderbeg, Bosnia attained
her zenith under Tvrtko I. But in each case with the death of the great
man the power which he had rapidly acquired as rapidly waned.
Tvrtko’s realm was no exception to this rule. Its founder had not lived
long enough to weld his conquests into an harmonious whole, to combine
Catholic Croats with Orthodox Serbs, Bosnian Slavs with the Latin
population of the Dalmatian coast towns, Bogomile heretics with zealous
partisans of Rome. The old Slavonic law of succession, which did not
recognise the custom of primogeniture, added to the difficulties by
multiplying candidates; and thus foreign princes found an excuse for
intervention and the great barons an excuse for independence. Deprived
of his authority, the King was unable to cope with an enemy like the
Turk, whose vast hosts were absolutely united in their obedience to the
rule of one man, and the Kings of Hungary, instead of assisting their
brothers of Bosnia against the common foe, turned their forces against
a country which might have been the bulwark of Christendom.</p>

<p>The evil effects of Tvrtko’s death were soon felt. His younger
brother, or cousin<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>, Stephen Dabisha, who succeeded him, felt himself too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
feeble to govern so large a kingdom, and in 1393 ceded the newly won
lands of Dalmatia and Croatia to King Sigismund of Hungary. The two
monarchs met at Djakovo, in Slavonia, and concluded an agreement by
which Sigismund recognised Dabisha as King of Bosnia, while Dabisha
bequeathed the Bosnian crown after his death to Sigismund. A combination
of Bosnian magnates and Croatian rebels, however, refused to
accept these terms, and Dabisha himself broke the treaty which he had
made. An Hungarian invasion of his Kingdom and the capture of the
strong fortress of Dobor, on the lower Bosna, at once reduced him to
submission, and a battle before the walls of Knin, in Dalmatia, finally
severed the brief connection between that country and the Bosnian
throne. To complete Dabisha’s misfortunes, the Turks, who had been
in no undue haste to make use of their victory at Kossovo, invaded
Bosnia for the first time in 1392, and gave that country a foretaste of
what was to come.</p>

<p>On Dabisha’s death in 1395 the all-powerful magnates, disregarding
the treaty of Djakovo, made his widow, Helena Gruba, regent for his
son. But they retained for themselves all real power, governing their
domains as almost independent princes, maintaining their own courts
and issuing charters, coining their own money and negotiating on their
own account with foreign states, such as the Republics of Venice and
Ragusa. One of their number, Hrvoje Vuktchich, towered above his
fellows, and his career may be regarded as typical of his troublous times.
For the next quarter of a century Bosnian history is little else than the
story of his intrigues, and the neighbouring lands of Dalmatia and Croatia
felt his heavy hand. Even Sigismund, King of Hungary, and his
Neapolitan rival, Ladislaus, were bidding against one another for his
support, and at the end of the fourteenth century he was “the most
powerful man between the Save and the Adriatic, the pillar of two Kings
and Kingdoms.” The shrewd Ragusans wrote to him that “whatsoever
thou dost command in Bosnia is done”; the documents of the period
style him <i>regulus Bosnensis</i>, or “Bosnian kinglet”; he called himself
“the grand <i>voivode</i> of the Bosnian Kingdom and vicar-general of the
most gracious sovereigns King Ladislaus and King Ostoja, the excellent
lord, the Duke of Spalato.” The three great islands of Brazza, Curzola,
and Lesina, and the city of Cattaro owned his overlordship, and his
name will always be connected with the lovely town of Jajce, at the
confluence of the Pliva and the Vrbas, the most beautiful spot in all
Bosnia. Here, above the magnificent waterfall on the hill, for which in
olden times the Bosnian <i>bans</i> and the Croatian Kings had striven, Hrvoje
bade an Italian architect build him a castle. Whether the town of Jajce,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
“the egg,” derives its name from the shape of the hill or from the fact
that the castle was modelled on the famous Castello dell’ Uovo at
Naples, is doubtful. But he is now regarded as the founder of the
catacombs, which still bear his arms and were intended to serve as his
family vault<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>. For his capital of Spalato he even issued coins, which
circulated in Bosnia as freely as the currency of the puppet kings whom
he put on the throne. What Warwick the king-maker is in the history
of England, what the mayors of the palace are in the history of France,
that is Hrvoje in the annals of mediæval Bosnia. An ancient missal has
preserved for us the features of this remarkable man, whose gruff voice
and rough manners disgusted the courtly nobles of the Hungarian court.
But the uncouth Bosniak took a terrible revenge on his gentle critics.
When a wit made fun of his big head and deep voice by bellowing at
him like an ox, the company laughed at Hrvoje’s discomfiture. But when,
a little later, the fortune of war put the jester in his power, Hrvoje had
him sewn into the skin of an ox and thrown into the river, with the
words, “Thou hast once in human form imitated the bellowing of an ox,
now therefore take an ox’s form as well.”</p>

<p>The great Turkish invasion, which took place in 1398 and almost
entirely ruined Bosnia, convinced the great nobles that a woman was
unfitted to rule. Headed by Hrvoje, they accordingly deposed Helena
Gruba, and elected Stephen Ostoja, probably an illegitimate son of
Tvrtko, as their King. So long as Ostoja obeyed the dictates of his
all-powerful vassal he kept his throne. Under Hrvoje’s guidance he
repulsed the attack of King Sigismund of Hungary, who had claimed
the overlordship of Bosnia in accordance with the treaty of Djakovo,
and endeavoured to recover Dalmatia and Croatia for the Bosnian crown
under the pretext of supporting Sigismund’s rival, Ladislaus of Naples.
But the latter showed by his coronation at Zara as King of both those
lands that he had no intention of allowing them to become Bosnian
possessions, as in the days of Tvrtko. Ostoja at this changed his policy,
made his peace with Sigismund, and recognised him as his suzerain.
But he had forgotten his maker. Hrvoje, aided by the Ragusans, laid
siege to the royal castle of Bobovatz, where the crown was preserved,
and when Sigismund intervened on behalf of his puppet summoned an
“assembly” or “congregation of the Bosnian lords” in 1404 to choose
a new King. This great council of nobles, at which the <i>djed</i>, or primate
of the Bogomile church, and his suffragans were present, is frequently
mentioned at this period, and contained in a rude form the germs of
those representative institutions which in our own country sprang from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
a like origin. Hrvoje easily persuaded the council to depose Ostoja and
elect Tvrtko II, the legitimate son of Tvrtko I, in his place. But
Sigismund was not so lightly convinced. After a first futile attempt he
sought the aid of the Pope in a crusade against “the renegade Arians
and Manichæans” and marched into Bosnia in 1408 at the head of a
large army. Tvrtko II met him beneath the walls of Dobor, on the same
spot where, fourteen years before, another great battle had been fought.
Once again the Bosnian forces were defeated. Sigismund took Tvrtko
as his prisoner to Buda-Pesth, after beheading 126 captive Bosnian
nobles and throwing their bodies into the yellow waters of the Bosna.
The victory had decisive results. Hrvoje humbled himself before the
King of Hungary, and Ladislaus of Naples sold all his rights to Dalmatia
to the Venetians in despair. But the national party in Bosnia was not
so easily dismayed. Nothing daunted by the defeat of Tvrtko and the
desertion of Hrvoje, they restored Ostoja to the throne. Utter confusion
followed. Sigismund dismembered the country, placing Usora and Soli
again under Hungarian <i>bans</i>, bestowing the valuable mining district of
Srebrenitza upon the Despot of Serbia to be an apple of discord between
the two Serb states, and leaving Ostoja the Herzegovina and South
Bosnia alone, while even there every one did what was right in his own
eyes, and members of the royal family lived by highway robbery. Well
might the Ragusans complain that “our people travel among the Turks
and other heathen, yet nowhere have they met with so much harm
as in Bosnia.” Yet one step lower was Ostoja to fall. Hard pressed
by the Hungarians and his released rival Tvrtko, he summoned in 1415
the Turks to his aid, and thus set an example which was ultimately fatal
to his country.</p>

<p>Since their great invasion in 1398 the Turks had not molested
Bosnia. Their struggle with Timour the Tartar in Asia and the confusion
which followed his great victory at Angora had temporarily checked
their advance in Europe, and it was not till their reorganisation under
Mohammed I that they resumed their plans. They were accordingly
free to accept the invitation of Ostoja and Hrvoje, who was now in
opposition to the Hungarian court, and aided them to drive out the
Hungarian army. The decisive battle was fought near the fortress of
Doboj, the picturesque ruins of which command the junction of the
rivers Bosna and Spretcha. A stratagem of the Bosniaks, who cried
out at a critical moment, “The Magyars are fleeing,” won the day. But
they could not rid themselves of their Turkish allies so easily. In the
very next year Mohammed appointed his general Isaac governor of the
castle of Vrhbosna (“the source of the Bosna”), which stood in the heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
of the country, on the site of the present capital of Sarajevo, and even
great Bosnian nobles were not ashamed to hold their lands by grace of
the Sultan and his governor. Under Ostoja’s son, Stephen Ostojich,
who succeeded as King in 1418, the country obtained a brief respite from
the Turkish garrison, which quitted Vrhbosna. But three years later
the restoration of Tvrtko II, after further years of exile, gave the Sultan
another opportunity for intervention. For Tvrtko’s title was disputed
by Ostoja’s bastard son, Radivoj, who called in the Turks to his aid,
and was seen by the traveller, De la Brocquière<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> as a suppliant of the
Sultan at Adrianople in 1433. Tvrtko purchased a temporary peace by
the surrender of several towns to them; but the fatal secret had been
divulged that the Sultan was the arbiter of Bosnia, and to him two other
enemies of the King turned, the Despot of Serbia and Sandalj Hranich,
a great Bosnian magnate of the house of Kosatcha, who was all-powerful
in the Herzegovina, so that Chalkokondyles calls it “Sandalj’s country<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>.”
The two partners bought the Bosnian Kingdom from the Sultan for
hard cash, and Tvrtko was once more an exile. In 1436 the Turks again
occupied Vrhbosna, which from that time became a place of arms, from
which they could sally forth and ravage the land, and when Tvrtko
returned in the same year it was as a mere tributary of the Sultan
Murad II, who received an annual sum of 25,000 ducats from his vassal,
and issued charters as the sovereign of the country. Soon Murad
overran Serbia, and occupied the former Bosnian towns of Zvornik and
Srebrenitza, which the Serbian Despot still held, so that it seemed as if
the independence of Bosnia was over. Tvrtko knew not which way to
turn. He implored the Venetians, who twenty years before had taken
the former Bosnian haven of Cattaro under their protection, and were
now masters of nearly all Dalmatia, to take over the government of
his Kingdom too. But the crafty Republic declined the dangerous
honour with many complimentary phrases. With Ladislaus IV of
Hungary he was more fortunate. He did not, indeed, survive to see
the fulfilment of the Hungarian King’s promise, for he was murdered
by his subjects in 1443. But the help of John Hunyady, the great
champion of Christendom, enabled his successor to stave off for
another twenty years the final blow which was to annihilate the
Bosnian Kingdom.</p>

<p>With Tvrtko II the royal house of Kotromanich was extinct, and
the magnates elected Stephen Thomas Ostojich, another bastard son
of Ostoja, as their King. Ostojich, whose birth and humble marriage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
diminished his influence over his proud nobles, came to the conclusion
that it would enhance his personal prestige, and at the same time
strengthen his Kingdom against the Turks, if he embraced the Roman
Catholic faith. His father and all his family had been Bogomiles, like
most Bosnian magnates of that time, but Tvrtko II was a Catholic
and a great patron of the Franciscans, who had suffered severely from
the Turkish inroads. The conversion of Ostojich was full of momentous
consequences for his Kingdom; for, although he was personally disinclined
to persecute the sect to which he had belonged, and which had practically
become the established church of the land, the pressure of his protector
Hunyady, the Franciscans, and the Pope soon compelled him to take
steps against it. He was convinced that by so doing he would drive the
Bogomiles, who formed the vast majority of the people, into the arms
of the Turks, and the event justified his fears. But he had little choice,
for the erection of Catholic churches did not satisfy the zeal of the
Franciscans. Accordingly in 1446 an assembly of prelates and barons
met at Konjitza, the beautiful town on the borders of the Herzegovina,
through which the traveller now passes on the railway from Sarajevo to
Mostar. The document embodying the resolutions of this grand council
has been preserved, and bears the name and seal of the King<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>. It
provided that the Bogomiles “shall neither build new churches nor restore
those that are falling into decay,” and that “the goods of the Catholic
Church shall never be taken from it.” No less than 40,000 of the
persecuted sect emigrated to the Herzegovina in consequence of this
decree, and found there a refuge beneath the sway of the great magnate
Stephen Vuktchich, of the house of Kosatcha, who had succeeded his
uncle Sandalj in 1435, made himself practically independent of his liege
lord of Bosnia and was at the same moment on good terms with the
Turks and a strong Bogomile. Thus the old Bosnian realm was practically
divided in two; Stephen Vuktchich, by posing as a defender of the
national faith, received a considerable accession of subjects, and the
Emperor Frederick III bestowed upon him in 1448 the title of <i>Herzog</i>,
or Duke, of St Sava, from which his land gradually derived its present
name of Herzegovina<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>. But both Bosnia and the sister land were soon
to feel the hand of the Turk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span></p>

<p>The accession of Mohammed II to the Turkish throne in 1451 was
the beginning of a new era for the Balkan peoples. Since the battle of
Kossovo the Sultans had been content to allow the Serbs the shadow of
independence under Despots of their own, while Bosnia had bought off
invasion by a tribute, more or less regularly paid, according to the
vicissitudes of the Ottoman power. But the new Sultan resolved to bring
the whole peninsula under his immediate sway, and lost no time in
putting his plans into execution. The capture of Constantinople startled
the whole of Christendom, and the great victory of Hunyady before
the walls of Belgrade was small compensation for that hero’s death.
There was no one left to champion the cause of the Balkan Christians,
who were still occupied with their own miserable jealousies. Bosniaks
and Serbs were disputing the possession of the frontier towns, which the
Kings of Hungary had long ago made an apple of discord between them,
and Duke Stephen of the Herzegovina was invoking the aid of the Turks
at the very moment when all religious and racial enmities should have
been silenced in the presence of the common foe. But it has been the
misfortune of the Balkan peoples to have, like the Bourbons, learnt
nothing and forgotten nothing in their centuries of suffering. They have
never, save during the Balkan war of 1912-13, learnt the lesson of their
mutual jealousies, and have never forgotten their historic aspirations
from which those jealousies spring.</p>

<p>The King of Bosnia in this extremity sought aid from the west of
Europe. As an obedient son of the Roman Church, he had a right to
expect the help of the Pope; as a friend of the Venetians, he felt entitled
to the support of the Doge. But he met with little response to his
appeals. Venice, selfish as ever, was not anxious to embroil herself in
Bosnian affairs, and the Pope contented himself with proclaiming a new
crusade, addressing the King as the “warrior of Christ,” and promising
him “a glorious victory,” in which no one else seemed desirous to share.
Under these circumstances Ostojich had no alternative but to pay the
tribute, which he had refused in the first flush of Hunyady’s victory at
Belgrade. The one bright speck on the dark horizon was the possibility
of the union of Bosnia and Serbia under one ruler by the marriage of
Stephen Tomashevich, eldest son of Ostojich, with the eldest daughter
of the Serbian Despot<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>. On the latter’s death in 1458, the King of
Hungary acknowledged Stephen Tomashevich as Despot of all Serbia
as far as the river Morava, and it seemed for the moment as if the ancient
jealousies of the two neighbouring States had been finally settled and
a new bulwark erected against the Turks. But the aggrandisement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
the Bosnian royal family only increased its responsibilities. The important
town of Semendria, which the Despot George Brankovich had founded
on the Danube years before as a refuge from his enemies, and the two-and-twenty
square towers of which still stand out defiant of all the
ravages of Turks or Time, was strongly fortified, but its inhabitants
regarded their new master, a zealous Catholic and a Hungarian
nominee, as a worse foe than the Sultan himself. It is not, therefore,
necessary to assume, with Pope Pius II and the King of Hungary, that
Bosnian treachery betrayed them. When Mohammed II arrived at their
gates they surrendered without a blow. The other Serbian towns followed
the example of Semendria, and in 1459 Serbia had ceased to exist as a
State and became a Pashalik of the Turkish Empire. It was the turn of
Bosnia next. But Ostojich was spared the spectacle of his country’s fall.
Two years later he fell in an obscure quarrel in Croatia by the hands of
his brother Radivoj and his own son, Stephen Tomashevich, who
succeeded to the sorry heritage of the Bosnian throne, of which he was
to be the last occupant.</p>

<p>Stephen, son of Thomas, lost no time in seeking the aid of the Pope
against the impending storm. “I was baptized as a child,” he said
through the mouths of his envoys, “and have learnt to read out of Latin
books. I wish, therefore, that thou wouldst send me a crown and holy
bishops as a sign that thou wilt not forsake me. I pray thee also to bid
the King of Hungary to go with me to the wars, for so alone can Bosnia
be saved. For the Turks have built several fortresses in my kingdom and
are very friendly to the peasants, to whom they promise freedom; and
the limited understanding of the peasant observes not their deceit, for
he believes that this freedom will last for ever. And Mohammed’s
ambition knows no bounds; after me, he will attack Hungary and the
Dalmatian possessions of Venice, and then march by way of Carniola
and Istria into Italy, which he means to subdue; even of Rome he
ofttimes speaks, and yearns to have it. But I shall be his first victim.
My father foretold to thy predecessor and the Venetians the fall of
Constantinople, and now I prophesy that if ye help me I shall be saved;
but if not, I shall fall, and others with me.” To this eloquent appeal,
which so exactly depicted the position of affairs, the Pope replied by
sending his legates to the coronation—the first and last instance of a
Bosnian King receiving his crown from Rome. The ceremony took place
in the lovely citadel of Jajce, Hrvoje’s ancient seat, whither the new
King had transferred his residence from Bobovatz for greater security.
The splendour of that day and the absolute unanimity of the great nobles
in support of their lord cast a final ray of light over the last page of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
Bosnia’s history as a Kingdom. Tomashevich made peace with all his
own and his father’s enemies—with the King of Hungary, with his stepmother,
Queen Catherine, and with her father, the proud Duke Stephen
Vuktchich of the Herzegovina, now seriously alarmed at the advance of
the Turks, who had placed a governor at Fotcha and had carved what
was called the “Bosnian province” out of the district round it. The King
assumed all the pompous titles of his predecessors—the sovereignty of
Serbia, Dalmatia and Croatia—at a time when he could not defend his
own land, and made liberal grants of privileges to Ragusa at the moment
when he was imploring the Venetians to grant him a castle on the coast
as a place of refuge.</p>

<p>The storm was not long in breaking. Mohammed II, learning that
Tomashevich had promised the King of Hungary to refuse the customary
tribute to the Turk, sent an envoy to demand payment. The Bosnian
monarch took the envoy into his treasury and showed him the money
collected for the tribute. “I do not intend,” he said, “to send the
Sultan so much treasure and so rob myself of it. For should he attack
me, I shall get rid of him the easier if I have money; and, if I must flee
to another land, I shall live more pleasantly by means thereof<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>.” So
the envoy returned and told his master, and his master vowed vengeance
upon the King. In the spring of 1463 he assembled a great army in
Adrianople for the conquest of Bosnia. Alarmed at the result of his own
defiant refusal Tomashevich sent an embassy at the eleventh hour to
ask for a fifteen years’ truce. Konstantinovich, a Serbian renegade, who
was an eye-witness of these events, has fortunately preserved the
striking scene of Mohammed’s deceit. Concealed behind a money-chest
in the Turkish treasury, he heard the Sultan’s two chief advisers decide
upon the plan of campaign. “We will grant the truce,” said one of them,
“and forthwith march against Bosnia, else we shall never take it, for
it is mountainous, and besides, the King of Hungary and the Croats
and other princes will come to its aid.” So Mohammed granted the
envoys the truce which they desired, and they prepared to return and
tell the good news to the King. But early next day the eavesdropper
went and warned them that in the middle of the next week the Turkish
army would follow on their heels. But they laughed at his tale, for they
believed the word of the Sultan. Yet, sure enough, four days after their
departure, Mohammed set out. One detachment of his army he sent
to the Save to prevent the King of Hungary from effecting a junction
with the Bosniaks, while the rest he led in person to Sjenitza, on the
Bosnian frontier. His march had been so rapid and so secret that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
encountered little or no resistance, until he reached the ancient castle
of Bobovatz, which had stood so many a siege in Bosnia’s stormy
history. The fate of this old royal residence was typical of that of the
land. Its governor, Prince Radak, had been converted by force from
the Bogomile faith to Catholicism. He could have defended the fortress
for years even against the great Turkish army, if his heart had been in
the cause. But he was, like so many of his countrymen, a Bogomile first
and a Bosniak afterwards. On the third day of the siege he opened the
gates to Mohammed, who found among the inmates the two envoys,
whom he had so lately duped. Radak met with the fitting reward of his
treachery. When he claimed from Mohammed the price for which he
had stipulated, the conqueror asked him how he could keep faith with
a Turk when he had betrayed his Christian master, and had him
beheaded. The giant cliff of Radakovitza served as the scaffold, and still
preserves the name, of the traitor.</p>

<p>The fall of the virgin fortress filled the Bosniaks with dismay. At
the news of Mohammed’s invasion, Stephen Tomashevich had withdrawn
with his family to his capital of Jajce, hoping to raise an army and get
help from abroad while the invader was expending his strength before
the walls of Bobovatz. But its surrender left him no time for defence.
He fled at once towards Croatia, closely followed by the van of
Mohammed’s army. At the fortress of Kljuch (rightly so-called, as being
a “key” of Bosnia) the pursuers came up with the fugitive. The secret
of the King’s presence inside was betrayed to the Turks; and their
commander, anxious to avoid a lengthy siege, promised Tomashevich
in writing that, if he surrendered, his life should be spared. The King
relied upon the pardon and gave himself up to Mohammed’s lieutenant,
who brought him as his prisoner to the Sultan at Jajce. Meanwhile, the
capital, like the King, had thrown itself upon the mercy of the conqueror,
and thus, almost without a blow, the three strongest places in Bosnia
had fallen. Tomashevich himself helped the Sultan to complete his
conquest. He wrote, at his captor’s direction, letters to all his generals
and captains, bidding them surrender their towns and fortresses to the
Turk. In a week more than seventy obeyed his commands, and before
the middle of June, 1463, Bosnia was a Turkish Pashalik, and Mohammed,
with the captive King in his train, set out for the subjection of the
Herzegovina. But the “heroic Herzegovina” offered greater obstacles
to the invader than “lofty Bosnia.” Against those bare limestone rocks
the Turkish cavalry was useless, while the natives, accustomed to every
cranny of the crags, harassed the strangers with a ceaseless guerilla
warfare. Duke Stephen and his son, Vladislav, who in better days had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
wasted their energies in civil war, now joined hands against the common
foe, and Mohammed, after a fruitless attempt to capture his capital of
Blagaj, withdrew to Constantinople. But before he left he resolved to
rid himself of that encumbrance, the King of Bosnia, who could now be
no longer of use to his conqueror. Mohammed was bound by the solemn
promise of his lieutenant to spare his prisoner’s life. But, as soon as
his wishes were known, a legal excuse was invented for his inexcusable
act of treachery. A learned Persian in his camp, Ali Bestami by name,
pronounced the pardon to be invalid because it had been granted without
the previous consent of the Sultan. Mohammed thereupon summoned
Tomashevich to his presence on the “Emperor’s meadow,” near Jajce,
whereupon the lithe Persian drew his sword, and, with a spring in the
air, cut off the head of the last Bosnian King. According to another
version, Tomashevich was first flayed alive. By the command of the
Sultan, the <i>fetva</i>, in which Ali Bestami had composed the captive
monarch’s sentence, was carved on the gate of Jajce, where as late as
the middle of the last century could be read the words, “The true
believer will not allow a snake to bite him twice from the same hole,”
an allegory by which the pliant Persian strove to excuse his master’s
treachery by representing his victim as the traitor. The body of
Tomashevich was buried by order of the Sultan at a spot only just
visible from the citadel of Jajce. In 1888 Dr Truhelka, the distinguished
archæologist and custodian of the museum of Sarajevo, discovered on
the right bank of the river Vrbas the skeleton of the King, the skull
severed from the trunk just as history had said, with two small silver
Hungarian coins, current in Bosnia in the fifteenth century, on the
breast-bones. When the present writer visited Jajce, he found the
skeleton set up in the Franciscan church there—a sad memorial of
Bosnia’s past greatness. His portrait adorns the Franciscan monastery
of Sutjeska. His uncle, Radivoj, and his cousin were executed after him;
his half-brother and half-sister carried off as captives, and his widow,
Maria, became the wife of a Turkish official<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, after an existence of eighty-seven years, fell the Bosnian
Kingdom. Mainly by the faults of her people and the mistakes of her
rulers, mediæval Bosnia lost her independence. The country is naturally
strong, and under the resolute government of one man, uniting all creeds
and all classes beneath his banner, might have held out, like Montenegro,
against the Turkish armies. But the jealousies of the nobles, and the
still fiercer rivalries of the Roman Catholics and the Bogomiles, prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
the way for the invader, and when he came the persecuted heretics
welcomed him as a deliverer, preferring “the mufti’s turban to the
cardinal’s hat.” This lesson of Bosnia’s fall is full of meaning for our
own time, and those who meditate on her future destinies should not
forget her past mistakes. She is perhaps the best and the saddest
example of what boundless mischief religious persecution can accomplish.</p>

<p>Bosnia had entered upon her four centuries of submission to the
Turks. Her King was dead, his consort and his step-mother, Queen
Catherine, in exile, and his people at the mercy of the conqueror. Many
of them were enlisted in the Turkish corps of Janissaries; many more
fled to Croatia, Istria and the Dalmatian towns; a few took to the
mountains, like the more or less mythical hero Toma, the Robin Hood
of the Bosnian ballads, and lived as brigands and outlaws; most of the
Bogomiles embraced the faith of Islâm, and became in the course of
generations more fanatical than the Turks themselves. It seemed as if
they would be left in sole possession of the land, but the earnest appeal
of a Franciscan monk induced Mohammed to grant the Christians the
free exercise of their religion and thus stay the tide of emigration from
the country. But, though Bosnia could not defend herself, the Turks
were not allowed undisturbed possession. Matthias Corvinus, King of
Hungary, had been outwitted by the rapid march of Mohammed, but
in the autumn of the very year in which Bosnia fell he set out to her
rescue. The campaign was successful, and, aided by Duke Stephen’s
eldest son Vladislav<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>, and a Herzegovinian contingent, the Hungarians
recovered Jajce, Banjaluka, and about twenty-five other towns. Even
the return of Mohammed in the next spring failed to secure the second
surrender of Jajce. Such was the terror of the Hungarian arms that
the mere report of the King’s approach made him throw his cannon into
the Vrbas and raise the siege. Matthias Corvinus now organised the
part of Bosnia which he had conquered from the Turks into two Duchies
or <i>banats</i>, one of which took its name from Jajce and the other from
Srebrenik. Over these territories, which embraced all Lower Bosnia, he
placed Nicholas of Ilok, a Hungarian magnate, with the title of King.
Thus, under Hungarian rule, two portions of the old Bosnian Kingdom
remained free from the Turks for two generations more, serving as a
“buffer State” between the Ottoman Power and the Christian lands of
Croatia and Slavonia.</p>

<p>The Herzegovina, which had repulsed the conqueror of Bosnia, did
not long survive the sister state. The great Duke Stephen Vuktchich died
in 1466 and his three sons Vladislav, Vlatko and Stephen, divided his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
possessions between them. The eldest, however, whose quarrels with
his father had wrought such infinite harm to his country, did not long
govern the northern part of the Herzegovina, which fell to his share.
He entered the Venetian service, and thence emigrated to Croatia, where
he died. The second brother, Vlatko, assuming the title of Duke of
St Sava re-united for a time the remains of the Duchy under his sole
rule, relying now on Venetian, now on Neapolitan aid, but only secure
as long as Mohammed II allowed him to linger on as a tributary of
Turkey. In 1481 he ventured to invade Bosnia, but was driven back to
seek shelter in his stronghold of Castelnuovo. Two years later Bayezid II
annexed the Herzegovina, whose last reigning Duke died on the island
of Arbe. The title continued, however, to be borne by Vladislav’s son,
Peter Balsha, as late as 1511. The youngest embraced the creed and
entered the service of the conqueror. Under the name of Ahmed Pasha
Herzegovich<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>, or, “the Duke’s son,” he gained a great place in Turkish
history, and after having governed Anatolia and commanded the
Ottoman fleet, attained to the post of Grand Vizier. His name and origin
are still preserved by the little Turkish town of Hersek, on the Gulf of
Ismid, near which he was buried.</p>

<p>All Bosnia and the Herzegovina, with the exception of the two newly
formed <i>banats</i> of Jajce and Srebrenik, were now in the hands of the
Turks. On the death of Nicholas of Ilok the meaningless title of “King
of Bosnia” was dropped, and his successors contented themselves with
the more modest name of <i>ban</i>, which had already been so familiar in
Bosnian history. But the Turks did not allow the Hungarian viceroys
undisturbed possession of their lands. Jajce became the great object of
every Turkish attack, and against its walls the armies of Islâm dashed
themselves again and again in vain. But after the capture of the <i>banat</i>
of Srebrenik in 1520, it was clear that the doom of Jajce could not be
long delayed. Two great feats of arms, however, shed lustre over the
last years of the royal city. Usref, the Turkish governor of Bosnia, who
will always be remembered as the founder of the noble mosque which is
the chief beauty of Sarajevo, had vowed that he would succeed where
his predecessors had failed. So he collected a large army and invested
Jajce. But, finding force useless, he pretended to raise the siege, so as
to take the place unawares. But Peter Keglevich, who was at that time
its <i>ban</i>, easily outwitted his crafty assailant. He bade the wives and
daughters of the garrison sally forth and dance and sing—for it was the
eve of a festival—on the “King’s meadow” outside the walls. Deceived
by this feint, the Turks made a night attack upon the town. As they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
came near, they heard the sound of the <i>gusle</i> and saw the feet of the
maidens dancing in the moonlight on the green sward. The sight was
more than they could bear. Casting their scaling ladders aside, they
rushed upon the damsels instead of climbing the walls. At that moment
Keglevich charged at the head of his men, while at the sound of the
cannon a second detachment, which he had sent out into the woods,
attacked the besiegers in the rear. Even the women bore their part in
the fight, and not a Turk left the field alive. Once again Keglevich held
his capital against the foe. Usref reappeared with a new army and laid
siege to the city for a year and a half. Hunger began to make its
appearance, even horse-flesh was unprocurable, and one mother threw
her child into the Vrbas rather than see it die a lingering death; it
seemed as if the garrison must surrender or starve. But Keglevich
managed to despatch a trusty messenger to Buda-Pesth, where, in
Count Frangipane he found a ready listener. Backed up by King Louis II
of Hungary and the Pope, he raised an army and relieved the town, after
a great battle. Frangipane received from the delighted King the title
of “Defender and Protector of the Kingdoms of Dalmatia, Croatia, and
Slavonia” in return for this signal service. But next year King Louis fell
in the fatal battle of Mohács at the hands of the Turks, and from that
moment Hungary was unable to protect her Bosnian outpost. Keglevich,
weary of warfare and old in years, gave up the <i>banat</i> of Jajce to King
Ferdinand I, who put a German garrison into the capital. But the
German soldiers had had no experience of Turkish warfare, and their
new commanders lacked the spirit of old Keglevich. Usref saw that the
moment had come to redeem his former failures. Hungary and Croatia
were in the throes of civil war, and not a hand was stretched out to save
the doomed city. A ten days’ siege by the allied forces of Usref and his
colleague, the Vizier of Serbia, was sufficient to make Jajce surrender.
Banjaluka held out a little longer, and its brave governor set fire to the
town rather than give it up to the enemy. With its fall, in 1528, all
Bosnia was in the possession of the Turks, and for the next 170 years
the German Emperors, who were now also Kings of Hungary, could
make no effort to substantiate the old Hungarian claims to the lands
south of the Save. Bosnia served as the starting-point from which
Turkish armies ravaged their adjoining territories, and until the Ottoman
power began to wane at the end of the seventeenth century, the Habsburgs
had quite enough to do in defending their own land.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the Turks organised the conquered provinces,
without interfering with the feudal system, which had struck its roots
so deep in Bosnian soil. A Turkish governor, called at first by the title<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
of <i>sandjak beg</i> and then by those of Pasha and <i>Vali</i>, represented the
majesty of the Sultan, and moved his residence according to the
requirements of Turkish policy. In the early days his seat was at
Vrhbosna, round which the city of Sarajevo grew up; but, as the Turkish
arms advanced further, Banjaluka was chosen as the official capital,
while, when they receded at the close of the seventeenth century, the
Pasha moved to Travnik, whence he issued his proclamations as “<i>Vali</i>
of Hungary.” But, however high-sounding his titles, the Turkish
governor was often, as the Bosnian Kings had been, the mere figure-head,
while all real power was in the hands of the great nobles, who gradually
became hereditary headmen or <i>capetans</i> of the forty-eight divisions of
the province. So strong was their influence that they long resisted all
attempts to transfer the Turkish headquarters from Travnik back to
Sarajevo, and permitted the Pasha to visit the present capital only on
sufferance and to remain there no more than forty-eight hours. It was
not till 1850 that Omar Pasha put down all resistance and re-established
the seat of government at Sarajevo, where it has since remained. But
throughout the Turkish period the native aristocracy of Bosnia merely
tolerated the Sultan’s representatives, of whom there were no less than
214 in 415 years, or an average of one every twenty months, and at
times even flatly refused to obey orders from Constantinople itself. In
a word, Bosnia under the Turks was an aristocratic republic, with
a titular foreign head.</p>

<p>The social condition of the country changed, indeed, very little with
the change of government. The Bogomiles, who had formed the bulk of
the old Bosnian aristocracy, hastened to embrace the faith of Islâm
upon the Turkish invasion. They had preferred to be conquered by the
Sultan than converted by the Pope; and, when once they had been
conquered, they did not hesitate to be converted also. The Mussulman
creed possessed not a few points of resemblance with their own despised
heresy. It conferred, too, the practical advantage upon those who
embraced it of retaining their lands and their feudal privileges. Thus
Bosnia presents us with the curious phenomenon of an aristocratic caste,
Slav by race yet Mohammedan by religion. Hence the country affords
a striking contrast to Serbia. There the Mohammedans were never
anything more than a foreign colony of Turks; here the Mohammedans
were native Slavs, men of the same race as the Christians, whom they
despised. But, while the Bosnian nobles, henceforth styled <i>begs</i> or <i>agas</i>
according as they were of greater or less distinction, never forgot that
they were Bosniaks, they displayed the customary zeal of converts, and
out-Ottomaned the Ottomans in their religious fanaticism. On the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
hand, they carefully preserved the heirlooms of their Bogomile forefathers,
the Serb speech, and the old Glagolitic script; on the other,
they were keener in the cause of Islâm than the Commander of the
Faithful himself. The iron of papal persecution had entered into their
ancestors’ souls, and the legacy thus inherited influenced the whole
future of Bosnia. The Turks were not slow to recognise the merits of
these new allies. It soon became a maxim of state that “one must be
the son of a Christian renegade to attain to the highest dignities of the
Turkish Empire.” In the long list of Pashas of Bosnia, we notice several
who were called “the Bosniak” from their race. As early as 1470 we
find mention of a native governor, Sinan Beg, who built the mosque
at Tchajnitza, his birth-place. Just a century later a Herzegovinian
renegade became Grand Vizier, and his successor was a member of the
famous Bosnian family of Sokolovich, to whom tradition ascribes the
foundation of Sarajevo. The natural aptitude of the Bosniaks for
managing their own countrymen led the Sultans to choose their
representatives from among them; for, in a highly aristocratic community
like Bosnia, the head of an old family enjoyed far more respect, even
though he were poor, than an upstart foreigner, who had nothing to
commend him but his ostentation and his office. Now and again we hear
of a Turkish governor like Usref, the conqueror of Jajce, whose word is
supreme, and whose religious endowments are “richer than those in any
other province of the Empire.” But the general rule is that the native
nobles are the repositories of power, while the Sultan’s representative
is a mere fleeting figure, here to-day and gone to-morrow.</p>

<p>While most of the Bogomiles had gone over to Islâm, there still
remained some who adhered to the ancient doctrines of that maligned
sect. The question has been much discussed as to the existence of these
sectaries in Bosnia to-day. That some of them were still to be found in
the beginning of the seventeenth century is clear from the report of
a traveller of that period. A century and a half later the Franciscans
asserted that the sect was extinct. This sweeping assertion does not,
however, accord with later discoveries. There are parts of the Herzegovina,
almost inaccessible till the construction of the railway from
Sarajevo to Mostar, where traditions of the Bogomiles still linger. Thus,
in the neighbourhood of Jablanitza, a region covered with Bogomile tombstones,
the women, although Mohammedans, go unveiled—a custom all
the more remarkable because the Mussulmans of Bosnia are, as a rule, far
more particular about veiling than their co-religionists at Constantinople.
It is, therefore, thought that this may be an old Bogomile observance,
and it is stated by a recent ecclesiastical historian that only a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
years before the Austrian occupation a family named Helej, living near
Konjitza, abandoned the “Bogomile madness” for the Mohammedan faith.</p>

<p>Bosnia, “the lion that guards the gates of Stambûl,” as the Turkish
annalists called her, had to bear the full brunt of the struggle between
Christendom and Islâm, as soon as the power of the Turks was beaten
back from before the walls of Vienna, and driven out from within the
walls of Buda-Pesth. The tide of Ottoman invasion began to ebb at the
close of the seventeenth century from Hungary, Croatia and Slavonia,
and the rivers Save and Una once more formed the boundaries between
the domains of the Crescent and the Cross. Not without reason did the
Bosniaks talk of “going to Europe” when they traversed the Save.</p>

<p>And now, after more than a century and a half of forgetfulness, the
House of Habsburg remembered the ancient claims of the Hungarian
Crown to the old Bosnian Kingdom. Henceforth, from being the
starting-point of every Turkish attack upon the Hungarian dominions,
Bosnia became the object of every expedition from beyond the Save
and the Una. Ten times did the Imperial troops enter the country
without permanent results, until at last in our own days the Austro-Hungarian
forces occupied it with the consent of Europe. The first
expedition, led by Prince Louis of Baden in 1688, entered Bosnia from
the east, captured Zvornik, but collapsed before the strong fortifications
of Banjaluka. Two years later an Imperial general beat the Turks near
Dolnja Tuzla, and took back a number of Catholic Bosniaks with him
to Croatia. In that year, indeed, the condition of the country was most
miserable. Famine and pestilence raged unchecked, and the quaint old
Franciscan monk who wrote a chronicle of that time, tells us how
“blood-red snow fell upon the mountains,” and how the devil went about
with bow and arrows to slay the people. One memorial of that <i>année
terrible</i> still remains in the shape of a Turkish copper coin, which was
minted in Sarajevo to defray the expenses of the Turkish army, and is
almost the only example of a separate Turkish currency for Bosnia. A
third invasion from the side of Croatia in 1693, although fairly successful,
pales beside the daring exploit of Prince Eugène in 1697. This twenty
days’ campaign has never been forgotten, and it is all the more interesting,
because the dashing Prince of Savoy took the same route which was
followed by the main body of the Austro-Hungarian army in 1878.
Crossing the Save at Brod with 6000 men, the Prince went straight up
the valley of the Bosna, along the course of the present railway to
Sarajevo, capturing on his way Doboj, Maglaj, Jeptche and the
picturesque Vranduk, rightly named in Turkish “the gate” of the
country. Sarajevo itself seemed at his mercy, but the Bosnian Christians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
did not respond to his appeals, there was no rising of the <i>rajah</i> in his
favour, and he retired with an immense booty and 40,000 Christian
refugees, whom he settled in Slavonia. The peace of Carlovitz two years
later ratified the old boundaries of the Turk and Christendom.</p>

<p>But the war between the Emperor and the Sultan, which broke out
in 1716, and was terminated by the peace of Passarovitz, had favourable,
if only temporary, results for Bosnia as well as for Serbia. The military
efforts of the Imperial troops in Bosnia were unsuccessful, but at the
peace, just as Belgrade and half Serbia were rescued from the Turk, so
also north Bosnia was transferred to the Emperor in his capacity of King
of Hungary and Croatia. But the disastrous peace of Belgrade in 1739
restored all that had been gained at Passarovitz in 1718. The strategy
of the Duke of Hildburghausen and Baron Raunach, the Imperial
commanders in Bosnia, utterly failed before Ostrvitza and Banjaluka,
and the Save and the Una once more became the frontiers. No Imperial
army crossed them again for half a century, and even then it merely
crossed to return empty-handed. The peace of Sistova in 1791 ratified
that of Belgrade, and Bosnia remained, in spite of Austrian victories,
a Turkish province, in fact till 1878, in name till 1908.</p>

<h3 id="heading26">4. BALKAN EXILES IN ROME</h3>

<p>Those of us who are students of <i>Punch</i> may remember a caricature,
which appeared in 1848, the year of almost universal revolution. Two
distinguished foreigners were represented as arriving at Claridge’s Hotel
and asking for accommodation. “I regret,” replied the manager, “that I
cannot oblige you; my hotel is entirely occupied by dethroned monarchs,
all except one single-bedded room, and that I am reserving, in case of
necessity, for His Holiness the Pope!” What London was to the royal
refugees of western Europe in 1848, that was Rome to the Balkan exiles
of the second half of the fifteenth century. The Pope was then their
generous host, and the Borgo their Claridge’s Hotel. In the words of
Pius II’s biographer, “he summoned to Rome almost all those whom
the Turks had ejected from their homes, and contributed money for
their maintenance<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>.”</p>

<p>There has never been a period in the history of the Near East, when
such a clean sweep has been made of principalities and powers. When
Pope Nicholas V celebrated the mid-century Jubilee, the Balkan peninsula
and the Levant were still largely occupied by a long series of Christian
States, which had existed there for well-nigh 250 years. The romantic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
Duchy of Athens was still standing under the Acciajuoli of Florence;
the Morea was divided between the two brothers Thomas and Demetrios
Palaiologos; their more famous brother, the Emperor Constantine, had
just left his Peloponnesian palace at Mistra, the Sparta of the Middle
Ages, to ascend the throne of all the Cæsars at Constantinople. The
Italian family of Crispo, from whom the greatest Italian statesman of
our time traced his descent, still ruled from their castle at Naxos over
the far-flung Duchy of the Archipelago. Another Italian clan, the Gattilusj
of Genoa, in whose veins flowed both the Imperial blood of the Greek
Emperors and that of the House of Savoy, were still governing the
island of Lesbos and the city of Ænos in Thrace, with their respective
dependencies. A Genoese syndicate, the <i>Maona</i> of the Giustiniani, the
forerunner of the Chartered Companies of our time, managed the rich
mastic-plantations of the island of Chios. The picturesque Kingdom of
Cyprus, with which were united the long-empty titles of King of
Jerusalem and King of Armenia, was still in the hands of the French
family of Lusignan, to which our Richard Cœur-de-Lion had sold it
more than two-and-a-half centuries earlier; but the most important
Cypriote harbour, that of Famagosta, where the Lusignans had been
wont to be crowned Kings of Jerusalem, had passed into the possession
of the Genoese Bank of St George, that famous institution, whose palace,
lately restored, is now the seat of the Genoese Harbour Board. The
family of Tocco, whose ancestors had migrated to Greece from Benevento,
had just lost almost the last fragment of its possessions on the Greek
mainland, but still retained the County Palatine of Cephalonia, which
embraced four of the Ionian Islands and included the mythical realm
of Odysseus. Venice was still the Queen of the Adriatic. The whole of
the Dalmatian coast was Venetian, save where the commercial Republic
of Ragusa maintained that independence, of which the recently erected
statue of Orlando was the symbol and still is the memorial. From the
southern extremity of Dalmatia, a chain of Venetian harbours—Antivari,
Dulcigno and Durazzo—names familiar to modern diplomacy—united
the northern territories of Venice with her colony of Corfù. Far to the
south she held Crete; off the east coast of Greece she occupied the long
island of Eubœa. In the north of the Balkan peninsula, Serbia was still
a Christian Principality, and the riches of its Prince, derived from the
Serbian mines, were almost fabulous. Montenegro, under the first of its
“Black Princes,” had started on its career of independence; Albania was
still largely unconquered, owing to the heroic resistance of the great
national hero, Skanderbeg; while its capital, Scutari, was still a Venetian
colony. The mediæval Kingdom of Bosnia with its elaborate feudal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span>
system, still survived; the sister-land of the Herzegovina, then known
as Hum, was ruled by a great Slav magnate, Stephen Vuktchich, who
had lately received the title of Duke of St Sava, from which, in its
German form of <i>Herzog</i>, his former Duchy to-day retains the name of
the Herzegovina. Beyond the Danube, the two Roumanian principalities
of Moldavia and Wallachia were, the former still independent, the latter,
if tributary, still restive. And far away on the shores of the Black Sea,
the Greek Empire of Trebizond still lingered under the family of Grand-Komnenos—whose
Princesses were the most beautiful women, whose
Princes the most tragic figures of their time.</p>

<p>Such was the map of the Near East in 1450, on the eve of the
accession of the greatest of the Sultans, Mohammed II. With his advent
ancient Empires and mediæval Principalities disappeared as by magic,
and a political earthquake shook the thrones of the Levant to their
foundations. In 1453 the last Byzantine Emperor fell at his post on the
walls of Constantinople; the oldest political institution in the world
came to an end, and the Turkish capital was moved from Adrianople
to the Bosporus. In 1456 Moldavia was made to pay tribute, the
Gattilusj were driven from Ænos and the Acciajuoli from the city of
Athens; in 1459 Serbia, in 1460 the Morea and the rest of the Duchy of
Athens ceased to exist. Next year the Empire of Trebizond was incorporated
with Turkey, the year following the Gattilusj no longer ruled
over Lesbos. In 1463 the last native King of Bosnia was beheaded in
the presence of the great Sultan on the meadow opposite the lovely city
of Jajce; in 1468 the death of Skanderbeg deprived Albania of her brave
defender. Two years later Venice lamented the loss of Eubœa, the
greatest blow that had ever befallen the Republic. In 1479 the Tocchi
were driven from their island county; by 1483 the Herzegovina was
wholly Turkish. The rulers and nobles of most of these countries sought
refuge in Rome, and thus the epilogue of the long and tragic drama of
Balkan history was played here. Italy was their nearest land of refuge;
it had been the cradle of many of their ancestors; and the Pope was
the head of Western Christendom, to whom some of them had appealed
in their distress.</p>

<p>The most notable of these distinguished exiles was the Despot Thomas
Palaiologos, who sailed from Corfù for Ancona towards the end of 1460,
accompanied by most of his magnates, and bearing the head of St Andrew,
which had long been preserved at Patras. The relic was known to be
a valuable asset in the dethroned Despot’s balance-sheet, although
Amalfi already possessed a portion of the saint’s remains. Many Princes
offered large sums for it, and its fortunate possessor had accordingly no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span>
difficulty in disposing of it to the Pope in return for an annuity. The
precious relic was deposited for safety in the castle of Narni, while
Thomas proceeded to Rome, where Pius II bestowed upon him the
Golden Rose, the symbol of virtues which he had scarcely displayed in
his long career of intrigue, a lodging in the Santo Spirito hospital, and
an allowance of 300 gold pieces a month, to which the Cardinals added
200 more—a sum which his too numerous followers considered barely
enough for his maintenance and certainly not for theirs. Venice, however,
contributed a further sum of 500 ducats to his treasury, but the
cautious Republic begged him not to return to Corfù or any of her other
colonies, so as not to embarrass her then rather delicate relations with
the Turks. Meanwhile, on April 12, 1462, the day after Palm Sunday,
Pius II received the head of St Andrew at the Ponte Milvio, on the spot
where the little chapel of that Apostle with its commemorative inscription
now stands. A recent visit to the chapel, which has been
completely isolated, and is now standing alone in a network of tramlines
and roads, suggests the melancholy reflection that ere long it too
may be sacrificed to that <i>civile progresso</i>, which has cost this city so
many interesting mediæval monuments. Thomas’ fellow-countryman,
the famous Cardinal Bessarion, handed the case containing the head to
the Pope, who bade the sacred skull welcome among its relatives, the
Romans, “the nephews of St Peter”—a ceremony depicted on the tomb
of Pius II in Sant’ Andrea della Valle. Shortly afterwards, upon the
death of his wife, whom he had left behind in Corfù, Thomas summoned
his two sons, Andrew and Manuel, and his daughter Zoe to join him in
Rome. But before they arrived, he died, on May 12, 1465, and was
buried in the crypt of St Peter’s, where all efforts to find his grave have
proved fruitless. But every visitor to Rome unconsciously gazes upon
his features, for on account of his tall and handsome appearance he
served as a model for the statue of St Paul, which still stands at the
steps of St Peter’s.</p>

<p>Misfortunes make strange bedfellows, and a common disaster had
brought together as exiles in Rome, condemned to live upon the papal
charity, the former Greek Despot of the Morea and his enemy, the
natural son of the last Frankish Prince of Achaia. After two centuries of
conflict, the Greeks had succeeded, at the eleventh hour, in extinguishing
the rule of the Franks in the peninsula, only to fall themselves before
the all-conquering Turk. To consecrate the Greek conquest, Thomas
Palaiologos had married the heiress of Centurione II Zaccaria, the last
Frankish ruler, and the last legitimate descendant of a famous Genoese
family, which had made a fortune out of the alum-mines of Phocæa on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>
the coast of Asia Minor, become lords of the rich island of Chios in the
days before the Chartered Company, and had at last attained to the
throne of Achaia. But Centurione had left a natural son, Giovanni Asan,
who had raised the standard of revolt against the Greeks. Imprisoned
by Thomas in the splendid castle of Chlomoutsi, or Castel Tornese,
the mint of the Morea, whose ruins still stand on a tortoise-shaped
eminence which overlooks the fertile plain of Elis and the flourishing
harbour of Zante, he had escaped a lingering death by hunger, rallied
his old adherents, and actually received the congratulations of the King
of Naples and the Venetian Republic upon his release and their
recognition of his title. Thomas had, however, suppressed this rebellion
with Turkish aid, and the pretender had fled first to one of the Venetian
colonies, and thence to Naples, whence we find him writing for aid to
the Bank of St George in his ancestral city of Genoa<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>. In 1459 a Genoese
document reveals him begging the Genoese government to recommend
him to the generosity of Pius II. Genoa was at that time under French
rule, and the Duke of Calabria, who was the royal lieutenant, accordingly
wrote to Pius II and to Cardinal Lodovico Scarampi, the Patriarch of
Aquileia, who was the Pope’s Chamberlain, recommending to their
notice “the magnificent lord Centurione Zaccaria, not long ago Prince
of the Morea.” I think that there was a special reason for the activity
of the Genoese government on the exile’s behalf. There is in the Cathedral
of Genoa a splendid relic, known as “the cross of the Zaccaria,” and
consisting of a piece of the true cross, encased in gold and studded with
precious stones. This is said to have been brought by St John the
Evangelist to Ephesus, captured by the Turks when they took that
place, and pawned by them at Phocæa, which then belonged, as we saw,
to the Zaccaria family. In 1307, in consequence of a quarrel between
two of its members over the accounts of the alum-mines, Tedisio
Zaccaria begged the famous Catalan chronicler, Ramon Muntaner, who
was then encamped with the Catalan Grand Company at the Dardanelles,
to assist him in sacking the town. Muntaner informs us that his share
of the booty was this cross, and the problem has hitherto been to find
when and how it was brought to Genoa. Now, as there is no mention
of the cross at Genoa before 1466, I have no doubt whatever that it was
this last scion of the Zaccaria who brought it from Greece, just as his
brother-in-law, Thomas Palaiologos, had brought the head of St Andrew,
and disposed of it to the city of Genoa for a valuable consideration, of
which one portion was a letter of introduction to the Pope.</p>

<p>Until recently there was no trace of the “Prince of the Morea’s”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span>
sojourn in Rome. I noticed, however, in a book by a German scholar,
Gottlob, on the subject of papal finance, an allusion to a certain “Prince
of Sani.” There being no such place, it seemed to me that the learned
German must have misunderstood the name of Giovanni Asani.
Examination of the original documents in the “Archivio di Stato” proved
this surmise to be correct. The <i>Liber depositarii Sancte Cruciate</i> contains
numerous entries of twenty florins a month paid to <i>domino Johanni
Zaccarie olim Amoree principi</i>, beginning with September, 1464, and
ending with December 31, 1468, after which there is no more mention
of the pension, and the pensioner was therefore probably deceased.
These sums, which Paul II, and after him Sixtus IV, gave to Oriental
potentates in distress, were derived from the proceeds of the alum-mines,
discovered at Tolfa in 1462 by another exile from the Near East,
Giovanni de Castro, who had been engaged in the dyeing trade at
Constantinople, had fled to Rome after the Turkish conquest, and had
been appointed treasurer of the patrimony of the Church. Genoese
workmen, formerly employed in the alum-mines of Phocæa, were
summoned to Tolfa, the Pope declared that the discoverer deserved a
statue, Court poets wrote more or less excellent verses in his honour, and
Pius told the world that the alum of Tolfa had been given by Providence
as the sinews of war against the Infidels, and bade all good Christians
deal exclusively with the papal alum factory. Thus, by a curious
coincidence, the last of the Zaccaria kept body and soul together by a
pittance derived from the sale of that mineral, which had formed in
happier days the foundation of his forefathers’ fortunes.</p>

<p>In 1461 another very distinguished relative of the dethroned Imperial
family of Constantinople arrived in Rome—Queen Charlotte of Cyprus.
There are few more remarkable figures even in the romantic history of
the Latin Orient than this brave and masculine woman, the offspring
of France and Byzantium. Queen Charlotte was the only daughter and
heiress of King Jean II de Lusignan by his marriage with Helen
daughter of Theodore II Palaiologos, Despot of Mistra, and she was
therefore grand-niece of Thomas Palaiologos. Succeeding to the throne
of Cyprus in 1458, at the age of 18, she was already both an orphan and
a widow—for her first husband, a son of the King of Portugal, was dead—and
she therefore hastened to conclude a second marriage with her
cousin, Louis, Count of Geneva, second son of Louis, Duke of Savoy.
Her consort had already been engaged to a daughter of Robert III of
Scotland, and those of us who are of Scottish descent will learn with a
flush of pride that our business-like ancestors demanded a huge sum
as damages for this breach of promise. Possibly the young scion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
House of Savoy would have done better to establish himself in Scotland
rather than Cyprus; for his Cypriote bride in the year after her marriage
was driven from the greater part of her realm by her late father’s
illegitimate son James, aided by the Sultan of Egypt. The castle of
Cérines, or Kyrenia, however, which overlooks the sea to the north of
the island, and of which a full description has recently been published
by the British authorities, held out; and there the royal pair took refuge.
During an interval in the siege, the intrepid Queen and her feeble husband
journeyed to Rhodes on board a galley of the Knights, which lay in the
harbour, to ask for aid. The Grand Master, Jacques de Milly, received
them politely; but their journey had no practical results, beyond the
gift of some money, corn and cannon, and after their return the Queen
accordingly resolved to leave her husband at Cérines, and seek assistance
in the West. On this journey, however, between Cyprus and Rhodes, her
galley was stopped and pillaged by the Venetians, while some Mameluke
prisoners, who were on board, cut the rigging and nearly murdered the
Queen. Even thirty years later the Republic had not paid the damages
due for this high-handed act of piracy<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>. At last, under the escort of
Sor de Naves, the Sicilian governor of Cérines, the Queen arrived at
Ostia in the second half of October, 1461, and proceeded up the Tiber
till she reached St Paul-outside-the-walls. There she landed, and was
met by the Cardinals, who escorted her to the city, where she took up
her temporary residence at San Ciriaco<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>, the church mentioned by the
British visitor of 1450, Capgrave, recently introduced to our notice, and
which was the predecessor of Sta Maria degli Angeli in the Baths of
Diocletian. We have in the <i>Commentaries</i><a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> of Pius II an interesting
description of the royal suppliant on the occasion of her first audience
with the Pope. She appeared to be twenty-four years of age, she was of a
mediocre height, and dressed like a Frenchwoman, her eyes sparkled with
fire, and her tongue was “like a torrent.” It seems possible, however, that
the Holy Father may have exaggerated her volubility, owing to the fact
that she spoke in a language which was not his own. For to the end of
her days, Queen Charlotte, although she could write French, Italian, and
perhaps Latin, was unable to speak French and always used Greek, the
language of her mother. Indeed, in the most important business
transactions of her life, she resorted to an interpreter, whom we may be
surprised to find a man of English extraction—not the last occasion, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span>
fear, on which treaties relating to the Eastern question have been
negotiated by persons imperfectly acquainted with the language in
which they were negotiating. The Queen humbly kissed the Pope’s feet,
and on the next day delivered a set speech to him through the medium
of a translator. She began by firing off a well-worn tag from the <i>Æneid</i>,
which doubtless tickled the palate of the classical Æneas Sylvius, whom
she saw before her. “My first husband,” she said, “is dead; my second
is besieged: whether he be alive or dead, I do not know. Cérines is our
only refuge; on the way hither the Venetians have robbed me. I can
stand no more voyages by sea; I have neither horses nor money for a
journey by land.”</p>

<p>The Pope, who had refused to receive officially the envoys of her
rival, bade the Queen be of good cheer, for he would not desert her.
“You are expiating,” he replied, “the faults of your father-in-law, who
declined to offer Us aid against the Turks, and of your husband, who
would not even take the trouble to meet Us when We were at Mantua.
So We said, ‘the House of Savoy despises the Church’”—a remark
which might have been taken from a clerical newspaper of our own day.
Pius II concluded by the promise of horses and money for the journey
to her father-in-law’s Court in Savoy. She remained on this occasion
some ten days more in Rome, until she had seen the chief churches and
had had four or five audiences with the Pope, who gave her much corn
and wine for revictualling Cérines and twelve horses and 200 ducats for
her journey. On November 5 she wrote from San Ciriaco to the Florentine
Republic, stating that her business with the Pope was terminated, and
asking for a passport for the dominions of Florence. On the 20th she
reached Bologna, where she was lodged gratis at the “Osteria del Leone<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>,”
and whence she proceeded by way of Venice and Milan to Savoy. The
Duke of Milan and the Council of Geneva gave her a good reception; but
her father-in-law told her plainly that the connection with Cyprus had
“exhausted” his Duchy, and complaint was afterwards made of the
expense of entertaining her for nearly four months at Lausanne and
Thonon, where the Court then was. Her appeals to the King of Aragon
and to Pierre-Raymond Zacosta, the new Grand Master, were in vain;
so, after bequeathing the Crown of Cyprus to the House of Savoy in the
event of her death without heirs, the indomitable Queen returned in
September of 1462 to her island, and shut herself up once more in the
royal apartments at Cérines. Having obtained so little from the Christian
Powers, she sent the Count of Jaffa to ask the aid of Mohammed II,
offering to pay tribute and to surrender a city of the island to the Turks—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span>
fact, which is probably the origin of the erroneous statement of the
Greek historian, Phrantzes<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>, that Mohammed II rendered Cyprus
tributary. The Sultan’s reply was to order her envoy to be sawn asunder.
Meanwhile, her craven husband had abandoned Cérines and fled to
Rhodes, whence he returned to Savoy in 1464. At last, when the
garrison of Cérines was reduced to eat the cats that prowled along the
battlements, the Queen likewise sought refuge in Rhodes, whither many
of her knights and vassals accompanied her. Sor de Naves surrendered
the castle to her relentless enemy, who thus, in October, 1463, was King
of all Cyprus, save where the Banca di San Giorgio still held Famagosta.</p>

<p>The heroic Queen did not despair of recovering her Kingdom. She
wrote from Rhodes a year later to her husband, urging him to send
assistance, and telling him that her poverty alone prevented her from
reconquering it. But Louis had had enough of both his consort and his
castles, as the Italian chronicler<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> tells us, and remained for the rest
of his life, which ended in 1482, in his native land, without occupying
himself with either. Queen Charlotte continued to reside for several
years in Rhodes, whence she could watch Cypriote politics and where
she received a monthly allowance from the Order. The Holy See
continued to recognise her as lawful sovereign of Cyprus; and in 1471,
when the usurper sent the Archbishop of Nicosia to Rome to ask the
Pope to crown him King and to give him in marriage the hand of
Princess Zoe, daughter of Thomas Palaiologos and then a young widow,
living there under the care of Cardinal Bessarion, His Holiness refused
both requests. This is the version of the contemporary Greek chronicler;
but the Italian annalist cynically remarks that the Pope agreed to crown
him if he would marry the Holy Father’s niece, but that when the King
of Cyprus saw the lady’s portrait and heard her habits, he declined
the crown on such terms. Instead, he married the famous Catherine
Cornaro, who in 1489 brought the Kingdom of Cyprus to Venice.</p>

<p>Upon the death of the bastard in 1473, we find Queen Charlotte
renewing her attempts to recover the island. She then waited at Rhodes,
and endeavoured to negotiate with the Sultan of Egypt, who arrested
her envoy, and with the Venetian Admiral then in the Levant, who
plainly told her that he marvelled at her ignorance of the fact that
kingdoms were obtained by might not by right, and that Catherine
Cornaro was the adopted daughter of his government. A plot to deliver
Cérines to her failed; and, although there was a party in the island
favourable to her, most of the Cypriotes preferred the Venetians, as
being better able to protect them. Venice ordered her exclusion from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span>
the coveted kingdom, many of her followers abandoned her, when they
found that all chance of a restoration was over, and in 1475 she settled
at Rome in the Palazzo Spinola, or dei Convertendi, in the Piazza Scossa
Cavalli, where from September, 1476, Sixtus IV gave her a monthly
allowance of 200 ducats. But in her Roman exile she did not abandon
her schemes for the recovery of Cyprus. She had adopted Alonzo, son
of Ferdinand I, King of Naples, and her plan was to proceed to Cairo
on a Genoese galley, and thence, with the aid of the Sultan of Egypt,
to recapture her throne. The Sultan actually invested her with the
crown, and Venice was so much alarmed that a Venetian envoy was
authorised to proceed to Rome, and offer her an annuity of 5000 ducats,
if she would consent to reside on Venetian territory. Her schemes
failed; she returned to Rome in 1482, and continued to be the honoured
pensioner of the Pope. Such was the honour which he showed her, that
in November, 1483, on the occasion of an audience, she was granted a
seat “neither less distinguished nor lower than the chair of the Pontiff”—a
mark of attention, so the contemporary diarist<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> remarks, “which
was not approved by some.” On February 25, 1485, she ceded the
Kingdom of Cyprus to her nephew Charles, Duke of Savoy, whose
descendants, the present Italian dynasty, have thus inherited from her
the titles of Kings of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia. This document
was executed in the presence of several Cardinals, of her Cypriote
confessor, and of her councillor, James Langlois, who acted as interpreter.
In return for this act of cession, the Duke agreed to pay to his
aunt, as long as she remained in Rome, an annual pension of 4300 florins
and to provide her with a residence worthy of her rank. A subsequent
deed charged this pension upon the rates of Nice. The Queen did not
long enjoy this annuity; on July 16, 1487, she died at her Roman
residence of paralysis, and was buried in St Peter’s “near the chapel
of St Andrew and St Gregory,” and not far from the spot, where, eleven
years before, her faithful Chamberlain, Hugh Langlois, lord of Beirût,
had been laid to rest. Eleven Cardinals were present at the mass held
in St Peter’s for the repose of her soul; but her body was not allowed to
rest permanently where it had been placed. In 1610, at the time of the
destruction of the old basilica by Paul V, her tomb was opened, when
it was found to contain the remains of a woman of moderate height, a
few pieces of black silk, and some gilded buckles<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>. These remains were
then re-interred in their present resting-place in the crypt of St Peter’s,
where a slab in the pavement bears the simple inscription: “Karola Hierlm̅<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[507]</span>
Cipri et Armenie Regina obiit XVI Julii an D. MCCCCLXXXVII.”
Other memorials of the exiled Queen of Cyprus still exist in Rome. One
of the pictures (no. XXXI) in the Santo Spirito hospital represents her
as kneeling before Sixtus IV, and the inscription below describes how
“Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus, despoiled of her kingdom and her fortune,
flees as a suppliant to Sixtus IV, and is received by him with the utmost
benignity and munificence.” Torrigio adds, that on this occasion the
voluble Queen felt unequal to the task of expressing her admiration for
and gratitude to her benefactor. I think it is possible to identify the
personages who are depicted behind the kneeling Queen. The two divines
are probably John Chafforicios, her confessor, and Lodovico Podochatoro,
a member of a well-known Cypriote family, who became secretary of
Alexander VI and a Cardinal, and whose monument is still admired in
Sta Maria del Popolo. The laymen are, I would suggest, Hugh Bousat
and his wife, Charlotte Cantacuzene de Flory, daughter of the Count
of Jaffa, who were her pensioners and who were in receipt of a small
papal allowance as late as 1513, and Philip Langlois, who lived about
40 years in Rome, and was granted an annuity of 15 ducats from
Julius II, increased to 20 in that year. The vestments, altar cloths, and
the four lbs. of silver, which the Queen bequeathed to St Peter’s, have
disappeared, but another proof of her piety is to be found in her entry,
recorded in Latin by her own hand, into the Confraternity of the Santo
Spirito on March 27, 1478. An example of the seal, which she used in
Rome, is preserved in Turin, and reproduces the streamers of the
Cypriote Order of the Sword, while her two rare coins are, I believe,
in the King of Italy’s collection. Her little band of courtiers lingered on
for many years here; Innocent VIII recommended them to the charity
of the Duke of Savoy as distinguished by lineage and virtue; and one
of them, Giorgio Flatro, by marrying his daughter to Pietro Aldobrandini,
became the ancestor of Clement VIII. As late as January 1520, Leo X
assigned 70 ducats out of the alum-mines of Tolfa to two other Cypriotes
of the lineage of Lusignan—Eugène and John, natural sons of Queen
Charlotte’s rival, whom the cautious Venetian Republic had removed
from Cyprus with their mother and sister in 1477, and had imprisoned
in the castle of Padua, lest they should embarrass Catherine Cornaro<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>.
This is another example of papal generosity, which contrasts with the
selfish conduct of the Venetian Republic, and incidentally disproves the
statement of Count Mas Latrie<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>, that the two illegitimate sons of James II
died at Padua, where their sister is buried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[508]</span></p>

<p>Another exiled Queen was living in Rome at the same time as
Charlotte of Cyprus, and, like her, died and was buried here. Most
visitors to this city have seen the tomb of the Queen Dowager Catherine
of Bosnia in Ara Cœli; but perhaps her story is less familiar, because
the very interesting history of Bosnia is little known. Queen Catherine
was the daughter of Stephen Vuktchich, the Duke of St Sava, from
whom the Herzegovina derives its name, and boasted her descent through
her mother Helen from the mediæval Princes and Tsars of Serbia. Like
her father and most of the Bosnian rulers and nobles of the fifteenth
century, she belonged to the Bogomile or Patarene heresy, which
corresponded with the Albigensian heresy of Provence, which coloured
several centuries of Bosnian history, largely contributed to the Turkish
conquest of that country, and survived there in the case of one family
down to the memory of persons still living. Owing, however, to the efforts
of the papal legate, the young Princess was converted to Catholicism
probably at the time of her marriage in 1445, or 1446, to King Stephen
Thomas of Bosnia. A Slav poet has commemorated her beauty and sung
of her wedding; but her fate was hard, and many a tragedy was in store
for her. To marry her, Stephen Thomas had put away his first wife, a
woman of obscure birth, whom his proud barons would not accept as
their Queen, and it was the discarded consort’s son, Stephen Tomashevich,
who murdered him to obtain the crown on July 10, 1461, assassination
or abdication being the usual alternative of Balkan monarchs. Thus, at
the age of 37, Catherine was left a widow, with two children of her own,
Sigismund and Catherine. In view, however, of the political situation,
the stepmother and the stepson agreed to bury the past, and the Queen
Dowager remained in Bosnia till the fall of the Kingdom in 1463. Both
her children were then captured by the Turks and forced to embrace
Islâm, while she managed to escape to the Republic of Ragusa, where
the authorities offered her an annual rent for the land and houses of her
late husband, and where she presented “marvellous choral books,”
destroyed by fire in 1667, to the Franciscan convent. Thence she crossed
the Adriatic and came to Rome, where we find her in receipt of a monthly
pension of 100 ducats from 1466. In addition to this, Pope Paul II paid
to one Jacopo Mentebone, a Roman citizen, a sum of 20 ducats a month
from October, 1467, “for the rent of a house let with all the necessary
utensils to the Queen of Bosnia.” At the time of her death, she was
residing “near the Church of San Marco de Urbe in the Rione Pigna,”
surrounded by a considerable court of faithful Slavs, and she was a
personage of importance, figuring for example at the wedding of Zoe
Palaiologina in 1472. She had, however, bitter disappointments. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span>
father, the Duke of St Sava, who died in 1466, cut her out of his will;
the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, whom she begged to lend her
money for ransoming her children, declined to assist her. After a twelve
years’ residence here, she felt her end approaching, and on October 20,
1478, made her last testament, a very curious document of great political
interest. After directing that she should be buried in the church of
Ara Cœli, she expressed the hope, that one day the Kingdom of Bosnia
would once more submit to Christian rule—an aspiration accomplished
in October, 1908. Meanwhile, mindful of the munificence of the Holy See
and of the benefits which she had received from Paul II and Sixtus IV,
who had always treated her hospitably, helping her according to her
royal dignity with an annual pension and provision sufficient for her
necessities, she bequeathed her kingdom in trust to the Holy See, until
such time as her son or her daughter should return “from the vomit of
Mahomet” to the true faith. Should they, however, remain Mohammedans,
then Bosnia was to be at the absolute disposition of the Pope and his
successors. It was this clause which prompted a well-known Slavonic
journalist in Rome to announce immediately after the Austro-Hungarian
annexation of Bosnia in 1908, that the Emperor Francis Joseph would
receive the Bosnian crown, as the last native King of Bosnia had received
it, from the hands of the Pope. Having thus disposed of her phantom
kingdom, Catherine proceeded to bequeath the rest of her real and
personal property to the three faithful ladies-in-waiting, Paola Mirkovich,
Helena Sempovich and Maria Misglenovich, who had shared her Roman
exile. To the first she also left a legacy of 50 ducats, a dress of black satin
lined with squirrel, and another of black cloth lined with lynx; to the
second 25 ducats and a long gown of black cloth with a lining of marten-skin;
to the third 30 ducats and a long, simple gown of black cloth. To
her major-domo, Radich Klesich, she left 50 ducats, a scimitar inlaid
with silver, and a Turkish dress of red silk woven with gold, as well as
a sum of 38 ducats, which she had borrowed from him; to her servants,
George Zubravich and Abraham Radich, respectively 50 and 30 ducats.
To her son Sigismund she bequeathed his father’s sword, inlaid with
silver; but, if he remained an infidel, the precious heirloom was to pass
to her nephew Balsha, whom we find thirty years later as titular “Duke
of St Sava.” To both her children she also left a silver dagger, two cups
and two tankards of silver, with lids inlaid with emeralds. To the church
of Ara Cœli she devised her royal mantle of cloth of gold and a silk
dossal of divers colours for the altar, which had been used in her private
chapel; to the hospital of San Gerolamo degli Schiavoni all the furniture
and sacred vessels of the latter. The relics in her possession she bequeathed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span>
to the Franciscan church of St Catherine at Jajce—a church in which
she had always been deeply interested. In 1458, at her request, and
again in 1462, Pius II had granted indulgences to all who visited this
church, which was believed to contain the body of St Luke, brought
thither from the castle of Rogus in Epeiros<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>, and of which a beautiful
Italian <i>campanile</i> still remains. Finally, after naming her executors, she
directed that her will, together with the royal sword, should be presented
to the Cardinal bishop of Porto, the vice-chancellor of the Church, then
Rodrigo Borgia, afterwards Pope Alexander VI.</p>

<p>Five days later the testatrix died, and was buried in Ara Cœli, as
she had directed. It is said that over her grave was placed a Slavonic
inscription, which ran as follows: “To the Bosnian Queen Catherine,
daughter of Stephen, Duke of St Sava, and of the race of Helen of
the house of Tsar Stephen, and wife of the Bosnian King Thomas, who
lived 54 years and died in Rome October 25, 1478, this Monument was
erected by her own written orders.” This Slavonic inscription has,
however, long ago disappeared. It was fortunately copied by Palatino<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
in 1535 as an example of Slavonic writing from the monument in Ara
Cœli, with an accurate Latin version. Casimiro Romano<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>, the historian
of that church, states that the monument of Queen Catherine, with that
of Cardinal Alibret, was moved from the floor of the presbytery in front
of the high altar in 1590 to its present position on a pillar behind an
ambon to the left as one faces the altar. The Slavonic inscription was
probably then lost and the present Latin inscription substituted. This
latter corresponds with neither the Slavonic text nor the truth; for it
describes how “To Catherine, the Bosnian Queen, <i>sister</i> of Stephen,
Duke of St Sava, born of the race of Helen and of the house of Prince
Stephen, wife of Thomas, King of Bosnia, who lived 54 years and fell
asleep at Rome on October 25, 1478, this monument was erected by her
own written orders.” This inscription was obviously composed by someone
ignorant of her genealogy, for she was the daughter, not the “sister” of
Duke Stephen, and the word <i>sorori</i> is probably a misunderstanding of
the Slav <i>poroda</i> (“race”). On either side of her head is a coat of arms,
that of her husband and that of her father. The latter is so greatly worn,
that it can no longer be distinguished, but the former, which I examined
from a ladder, still shows, on a close inspection, the two crowns and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
the two horsemen, but not the mailed arm with the sword, which was in
the centre, as may be seen from the representation of this monument
in Ciacconius’ <i>Lives and Acts of the Popes and Cardinals</i>. The two crowns
in the quarterings are those of Bosnia and Serbia, for from 1376 the
Bosnian Kings always styled themselves also Kings of Serbia; the arm
with the sword represents Primorje, or “the Coastland”—also a part
of the Bosnian royal title; the two horsemen are the Kotromanich
emblem. Considering the worn appearance of the actual monument, and
the sharply cut lettering of the Latin inscription, I think that the latter
can never have been placed on the floor of the church, but was a later
addition, cut at a time when the Slavonic inscription was misunderstood,
or perhaps even mislaid. It is said by Luccari<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>, the old historian of
Ragusa, that another portrait of Queen Catherine exists in Rome, and
is to be found in the Sala di Costantino in the Vatican, where a woman
in the foreground may perhaps be the Queen.</p>

<p>The Pope did not forget the household of the testatrix. From the
next month after her death her three ladies, Paola, Helena, and Maria,
with a fourth named Praxina, received 14 ducats monthly from the
papal treasury. Her will did not, however, prevent him from recognising
another person as King of Bosnia. One of the paintings (No. 27) in
the Santo Spirito hospital represents the visit of “the King of Bosnia
and Wallachia” to the Pope, and the inscription adds how this monarch
“although exhausted by age visits the thresholds of the Apostles and
submissively venerates Sixtus IV by kissing his feet.” It does not seem
to have occurred to anyone to ask who this mysterious personage was,
although the last native King of Bosnia had been killed eight years
before the accession of Sixtus IV, and the conjunction of the crowns of
Bosnia and Wallachia is curious. It is not difficult, however, to identify
this sovereign. One of the old books, which alludes to the picture,
calls him “N.” which is the initial of Nicholas of Ilok on the Danube
(the place where Prince Odescalchi’s Hungarian castle is situated). This
great magnate, when the Hungarians temporarily captured Jajce from
the Turks, received from Matthias Corvinus in 1471 the title of “King
of Bosnia”—by which he is described in papal documents<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> of 1475-6.
As he was also <i>voivode</i> of Transylvania, whose inhabitants were Wallachs,
he is called also “King of Wallachia” in the inscription. His visit to
Rome may be fixed from a letter of Sixtus IV, dated May 2, 1475, in
which he is stated as having been “lately present.” Doubtless, he came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
for the Jubilee of that year, and this is the explanation of Wadding’s
erroneous statement, that Queen Catherine did not come to Rome till
1475.</p>

<p>Another Slavonic sovereign sought refuge in Rome. This was Stephen
Brankovich, Despot of Serbia, who had been blinded by Murad II years
before, and who, after the fall of his country had sought a refuge with
Skanderbeg, the heroic champion of the Albanians. There he married
Angelina, sister-in-law of Skanderbeg and daughter of Giorgio Arianiti,
a great Albanian chieftain. As the struggle in Albania became more
and more desperate, Skanderbeg, at the end of 1465, came to Rome
to ask the aid of Paul II, who received him with extraordinary honours,
due to one who was “the first soldier of Jesus Christ.” A memorial
of his stay here is the Vicolo Scanderbeg, where the house, No. 116,
bears his portrait over the door with the following inscription: “Geor.
Castriota A. Scanderbeg Princeps Epiri ad fidem iconis rest. an. Dom.
MDCCCXLIII.” Thence, at the end of January, 1466, he returned to
defend his fortress of Kroja, where two years later he died, and Albanian
independence with him. Before that event the Serbian Despot had left
him for Rome, for from December, 1467, he was drawing a papal pension
of 40 ducats a month, continued to his widow from December, 1479.
Here, too, her brother Costantino Arianiti found a living, becoming
protonotary apostolic under Sixtus IV, who gave him a monthly pension
of 32 ducats from October, 1476, increased to 40 from November, 1479—not,
indeed, much to keep up the position of one who styled himself
“Prince of Macedonia.”</p>

<p>The Turkish annexation of the County Palatine of Cephalonia in
1479 brought another band of Oriental exiles to Rome. The Tocco family,
however, which had ruled over the dominions of Ulysses for more than
a century, had gone from Benevento to Greece, and Leonardo III was,
therefore, merely returning to the land of his forebears. On February
29, 1480, he arrived in Rome with his son Carlo and his brothers
Giovanni and Antonio. A man so well connected was sure of a good
reception—for he had married a niece of King Ferdinand of Naples,
while the Pope’s nephew had married his sister-in-law, and he was
himself related to the Imperial houses of both Byzantium and Serbia.
Accordingly, the Cardinals’ servants met him outside the Lateran Gate
and escorted him to the house which he had hired between the Via
Pellicciaria and the Botteghe Oscure. Sixtus IV, whose predecessor had
already given him periodical sums of 1000 to 1200 ducats from 1466,
gave him 1000 gold pieces and promised him 2000 a year—an event
commemorated by another of the paintings in the Santo Spirito hospital,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[513]</span>
where we are shown how the Pope “nourished with his royal bounty the
rulers of the Peloponnese and of Epeiros, Andrew Palaiologos and
Leonardo Tocco.” After staying rather more than a month here, he
returned to Naples, leaving his natural son, Ferdinando, behind him—a
spirited youth, who once said in the hearing of the diarist, Volaterranus,
“though we have lost our rings, we have still got our fingers entire.”
Leonardo received valuable fiefs in the south of Italy, but died in Rome
under the pontificate of Alexander VI owing to the collapse of his house.
His son Carlo III lived in the Via S. Marco, where, after enjoying a
monthly pension, he died under Leo X, and we find that Pope paying
monthly pensions of 60 and 32 ducats respectively to two other members
of the family, Carlo’s sister Raymunda, Contessa de Mirandola, and his
son and heir (Giovanni) Leonardo IV, Despot of Arta, and a small sum
to Giovanni’s widow, Lucrezia<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>. The family of Tocco has only lately
become extinct by the deaths of the Duca della Regina in 1908 and of
his only son, the Duca di S. Angelo, in the motor accident near Cassino
in 1907. At Naples in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele may still be seen a
collection of the family portraits in the fine old Palazzo del Santo Piede
(now Troise) so-called, from the foot of St Anna, which Leonardo III
brought with him from Greece.</p>

<p>The heirs of the Palaiologoi were less fortunate than those of
Leonardo Tocco. Upon the death of Thomas, Cardinal Bessarion drew
up a scheme of education for his children, to whom the Pope continued
his allowance. He laid it down, that they must not have an expensive
retinue, like their father, but that they must be brought up by Latin
priests as Latins. They were allowed a Greek doctor, one Kritopoulos,
but were to dress like Franks and to show the utmost reverence to the
Cardinals. They were to be taught to walk with dignity, to speak in a
soft voice, not to stare about them, not to boast of their Imperial lineage
but to remember that they were exiles and strangers, forced to live on
charity. They were to learn by heart a humble address to the Pope, to
talk little, never to laugh, and to acquire the art of kneeling with
elegance. In short, they were to be perfect prigs. The result of Bessarion’s
educational programme was what might have been expected. Zoe, or
Sophia, indeed, soon escaped his tutelage by marrying a Caracciolo,
after being regarded as a suitable bride for James II of Cyprus. The
historian Phrantzes, an old and tried friend of the family, who was then
in Rome on a visit, speaks with enthusiasm of the generosity of the
bridegroom. Soon left a widow, and again wooed by the Cypriote King,
she married by proxy in St Peter’s in 1472 the Grand Duke Ivan III of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span>
Russia—a ceremony commemorated by the above-mentioned painting
in the Santo Spirito hospital, in which, besides relieving Leonardo Tocco,
Sixtus IV is described as presenting “Sophia, daughter of Thomas
Palaiologos, married to the Duke of the Ruthenians, with a dowry of
6000 gold pieces and other gifts<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>.” These latter included 4400 ducats for
her travelling expenses to Russia, whither many of the family’s retainers
followed her, and where, in consequence of her Imperial origin, her
husband took the title of Tsar. But her brother Andrew, who remained
all his life a hanger-on of the papal court, profited little by Bessarion’s
precepts. Falling into dissolute habits, he married a disreputable woman
named Catherine; his garments moved the pity or contempt of the
Romans; his allowance was reduced, he was relegated to a back seat
at papal functions; and, after ceding all his rights to Charles VIII of
France at San Pietro in Montorio, he died at Rome in 1502 in such misery
that his widow had to beg his funeral expenses from the Pope. His
portrait is supposed to be represented in a lunette of the third room of
the Borgia apartments, where is also that of the Turkish Prince Djem,
younger son of Mohammed II, and so long the prisoner of the Vatican.
Thus the son of the conqueror of Constantinople and the nephew of its
gallant defender are both depicted in the same room.</p>

<p>Besides these exiled Princes, a number of Greek authors found a
permanent or temporary home in Rome, whither their famous fellow-countryman,
Bessarion of Trebizond, had preceded them. Created a
Cardinal in 1439 for his services to the Union of the Churches, he had
shortly afterwards settled in a house to the right of the church of the
SS. Apostoli, which gave him his title, and his abode became a literary
centre, where Greeks and Italians alike congregated. Theodore Gazes of
Salonika, George of Trebizond, and Nicholas Saguntino of Eubœa
frequented his house, and another Greek man of letters, Andronikos
Kallistos, lived with him, till poverty forced him to migrate to Florence
and thence to England, where he died. But with the exception of
Bessarion, who rose to be titular Archbishop of Nice and Latin Patriarch
of Constantinople, as well as bishop of Tusculum, and who narrowly
missed being elected Pope on the death of Paul II, these learned fugitives
met with the usual fate of scholars. Sometimes their misfortunes were
their own fault. Thus George of Trebizond, a man who could not endure
criticism, quarrelled with his patron over the rival merits of Plato and
Aristotle, with Gazes over their respective translations of the <i>maestro di
color che sanno</i>, and with Valla over the pre-eminence of Cicero over
Quintilian; at last, this cantankerous old man, the scourge of all authors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515"></a>[515]</span>
except Aristotle, crept about Rome in rags supported by a stick, till
he found near his humble abode a rest in the church of Sta Maria sopra
Minerva, where the inscription on his tomb has long been illegible. His
adversary Gazes, for whom Bessarion had obtained a benefice in Magna
Græcia, retired thither in disgust, because Sixtus IV paid him only
50 gold pieces for his translation of Aristotle’s <i>Natural History of Animals</i>.
Of Bessarion we have still several memorials: the tomb which he erected
during his lifetime in the monastery of the SS. Apostoli, the cup which
now belongs to the Greek monastery of Grottaferrata, of which he was
Abbot commandatory; the beautiful little house, called the <i>casino di
Bessarione</i> on the Via Appia within the city near the church of SS. Nereus
and Achillios. This “vineyard within the walls of the city <i>in loco qui
dicitur S. Cæsarii in Turri sub proprietate ejusdem monasterii S. Cæsarii</i><a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>,”
he bequeathed in 1467 with his property at “<i>Cecchignola nova extra portam
Appii</i>,” on the right of the Via Ardeatina, to the chapel of S. Eugenia in
the SS. Apostoli. When the <i>Zona archeologica</i> was being made in 1910, it
was proposed to destroy this picturesque house, then an inn, but now
deserted; but it was happily spared, after a protest. Argyropoulos, the
translator of Aristotle, who died here in 1486, has been immortalised by
Ghirlandajo in the Sistine Chapel, where he is the original of the
bearded old man in the scene of the calling of the first disciples, and also
in the Cancelleria<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>. The list of these literary wanderers may fitly close
with Janus Laskaris, the Greek grammarian, founder of a Greek school
at the foot of the Quirinal, whose tomb lies not far from the heart of
O’Connell in S. Agata in Subura, where a touching epitaph expresses the
mingled joys and sorrows of a Roman exile.</p>

<h3 id="heading27">5. THE LATIN KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM, 1099-1291</h3>

<p>No event of the late war was so dramatic, or has made such a
powerful appeal to the imagination, as the liberation of Jerusalem on
December 9, 1917, after a Moslem occupation of 673 years. While the
name of Athens is full of meaning for the cultured alone, and many
excellent citizens are not quite sure “whether the Greeks or the Romans
came first,” that of Jerusalem is known in every peasant’s cottage of
Christendom and represents the aspirations of an ancient race scattered
all over the globe. But to us Anglo-Saxons the redemption of the Holy
City has special significance, because a British general at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
a force gathered from every part of the British Empire, and aided by
our French and Italian allies, has repeated the achievement of Godfrey
of Bouillon and the Crusaders, among them a brother of the King of
England, and Edgar Etheling, the descendant of our Saxon line, in
1099, and has accomplished what even our lion-hearted monarch failed
to do in 1192, and our soldierly Prince Edward in 1271. Thus the
aspiration of the poet of <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">has been realised by Britons from lands whose very existence was
unknown at the time of the Crusades.</p>

<p>The present essay is not intended to be a drum-and-trumpet
history of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and its almost constant wars,
but an account of the organisation and social life of the Crusading
kingdom. First, as to its extent. The Kingdom of Jerusalem attained its
zenith at the end of the reign of Baldwin II in 1131, when it stretched
from the Egyptian frontier at El-ʿArîsh, “the river of Egypt” of the
Book of Numbers, on the south-west, and from Aila, the modern ʿAkaba
(on the gulf of the same name), the Eloth of the First Book of Kings,
and the site of Solomon’s Red Sea naval station, on the south-east, to
the stream now called Nahr Ibrahîm, which flows into the sea between
Beirût and Giblet, the modern Jebeil—about 300 miles as the crow
flies. To the east the kingdom rarely overstepped the Jordan except at
the triangle of Banias, the ancient Cæsarea Philippi; indeed, in the north
it was only thirteen miles broad, but in the Dead Sea region it attained a
breadth of 100 miles. This did not, however, comprise the whole of the
Latin territory. To the north of the above-mentioned stream stretched
the county of Tripolis, of which the foundations were laid by Count
Raymond of Toulouse in 1102, to the rivulet, now called Wâdi-Mehika,
between Maraclée and Valénia (the modern Bâniyâs), which flowed at
the foot of the castle of Margat—a further distance of about 100 miles.
From that rivulet began the Principality of Antioch, whose first Prince
was, in 1098, Bohemond of Taranto, and which at one time extended
almost to Aleppo in the east and embraced a large slice of the Kingdom
of Armenia almost as far west as Tarsus, but latterly extended no farther
north than a little beyond Alexandretta. On the north-east it was
bounded until 1144 by the County of Edessa, the modern Urfa, founded
by Baldwin I in 1098, which began at the forest of Marris and extended
eastward beyond the Euphrates; but, owing to the permanent state of
war, in which the forty-six years of its existence were passed, it never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517"></a>[517]</span>
had any fixed boundaries. Thus, a Syrian writer could truly say that,
in 1129, “everything was subject to the Franks, from Mardîn and
Schabachtana to El ʿArîsh,” far more than the “Dan to Beersheba” of
the Israelites<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>.</p>

<p>The first diminution of the Crusading States was the loss of the
County of Edessa in 1144. In 1170, at the other extremity, they were
cut off from the Red Sea by the capture of Aila. Jerusalem and most
of the kingdom, except Tyre and a few fortresses, fell before Saladin in
1187, after the battle of Hattin, which the Crusaders identified with the
site of the Sermon on the Mount, and the greater part of the Principality
of Antioch and of the County of Tripolis in the next year. By the treaty
of 1192, the Christians obtained the coast from Tyre to Jaffa; and
Frederick II, by the so-called “bad peace” of 1229, recovered the Holy
City, except two mosques, the two other towns—Bethlehem and Nazareth—most
closely associated with the life of our Lord, and all the chief
pilgrimage roads. Fifteen years later, however, the Kharezmians, a
Turkish tribe, finally captured Jerusalem, murdered the Latin
Christians, and desecrated the Holy Sepulchre and the tombs of the
Latin Kings. Saladin, in 1187, had treated Jerusalem as an English
gentleman would; the Kharezmians treated it in the German fashion.</p>

<p>The battle of Gaza completed the disaster of 1244. From that time
the recovery of Jerusalem was manifestly impossible. The Crusade of
the saintly Louis IX was a failure; that of our Prince Edward was
weakly supported, ended in a separate peace, concluded by the people
of Acre against his will, and was only remarkable for one of the most
beautiful stories of conjugal devotion in English history. Meanwhile
Antioch had fallen in 1268 before Beibars, the Mameluke Sultan of
Egypt; and Jaffa had entered upon the long captivity from which our
armies at last redeemed it on November 17, 1917. The Kingdom of
Jerusalem was thenceforth a mere phantom of its former self. Kings of
Cyprus were crowned Kings of Jerusalem at Tyre, with all the pomp
and splendour of the Middle Ages; Acre continued to be, as it had been
since its recapture by Cœur-de-Lion, the capital of Frankish Palestine,
where even on the eve of its fall, as a traveller<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> tells us, dwelt “the
richest merchants under Heaven, gathered from all nations, where
resided the King of Jerusalem and many members of his family, the
Princes of Galilee and Antioch, the lords of Tyre, Tiberias and Sidon,
the Counts of Tripolis and Jaffa, all walking about the squares with their
golden coronets on their heads.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[518]</span></p>

<p>There, too, were the headquarters of the Military Orders, the
Templars, the Knights of St John, the Brothers of the German House,
and the Masters and Brothers of St Thomas of Canterbury. But the
end of this carnival of Kings and Princes in exile was at hand. Since
the second capture of Jerusalem, the kingdom had been slowly but
surely dying, as its inhabitants knew full well. Signs and wonders
foretold to the pious the coming catastrophe; shrewd business men
hastened to sell their property in the doomed country. Tripolis followed
the fate of Antioch in 1289; Acre, Tyre, Sidon and Beirût were taken
by Melik-el-Aschraf, the Sultan of Egypt, in 1291; and, with the fall
of the last two strongholds of the Templars, Tortosa and Château
Pèlerin, ended the rule of the Franks in Palestine. In Gibbon’s phrase,
“A mournful and solitary silence prevailed along the coast which had
so long resounded with the world’s debate.”</p>

<p>Let us now see how Frankish Palestine was organised. At the head
of the Latin Kingdom stood the King. During the first three reigns the
monarchy was elective; and it was not till 1131 that it became hereditary,
as Baldwin II was the first sovereign who left progeny. When the
Crusaders entered Jerusalem, the election of their first ruler was by
means of an examination, from which few of us would emerge unscathed.
The electors questioned the servants of the various candidates about
their masters’ morals and characters. Godfrey’s attendants stated that
their master’s chief defect was, that he would linger on in church, after
the service was over, asking questions about the images and pictures,
and thereby making his household late for meals, “which thus lost all
their relish<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>.” But this interest in ecclesiastical archæology, which
seemed such a drawback to the hungry men-at-arms, was counted as a
recommendation by the pious electors, and Godfrey was elected. He
declined, however, to take the title of King, preferring that of “Protector
of the Holy Sepulchre,” and refusing to wear a golden crown in the city
where Our Lord had worn a crown of thorns<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>. His modesty was also
probably due to a tactful desire to disarm the opposition of the clergy,
who had desired that Jerusalem should not have a lay ruler. He died,
however, next year, and Baldwin I, Count of Edessa, his brother, who
was elected his successor, then took the title of King, but salved his
conscience by being crowned not in Jerusalem, but at Bethlehem.
Baldwin II’s daughter, Mélisende, and her husband, Fulk, were the
first to be crowned in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem,
where was also the royal mausoleum. Adelaide, Baldwin I’s Queen, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[519]</span>
buried at Patti. During the Moslem occupation of Jerusalem the King
was crowned at Tyre; and, when the whole of the Holy Land was lost,
the Kings of Cyprus, who were titular Kings of Jerusalem, assumed the
former crown at Nicosia and the latter at Famagosta. From Queen
Charlotte of Cyprus, in 1485, the title passed to Duke Charles of Savoy,
and thus to the present Italian dynasty.</p>

<p>The Latin sovereigns of Jerusalem were mostly above the average
in character and intelligence. Bravery and piety were essential to their
position as chiefs of a crusading colony in the midst of a hostile country.
Godfrey “excelled his contemporaries in the handling of arms and in all
the exercises of chivalry”; Baldwin I was described in his epitaph as
“a second Judas Maccabæus”—a comparison confirmed by his warlike
achievements; of Baldwin II we are told, that “his memory was blessed
by all, because of the excellence of his faith and the glorious deeds which
ennobled his reign.” Baldwin III was also a lover of literature and a
graceful speaker, of whom a Moslem rival said that “there was not such
another king in the world.” His brother, Amaury I, prompted Archbishop
William of Tyre to compose his valuable history, and both these
sovereigns possessed considerable legal knowledge. The Archbishop’s
pupil, Baldwin IV, was unfortunately a leper, and Baldwin V died in his
boyhood. Fulk was generous and experienced in warfare, but signally
lacked the common royal faculty of remembering faces. Queen
Mélisende, who was the real ruler in her husband’s lifetime, was an
excellent woman of business, of whom it was said that “she had in her
bosom the heart of a man<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>”; indeed, so masterful was she, that on one
occasion her son had to besiege her in the Tower of David. Unfortunately,
Guy de Lusignan, who was King at the moment of Saladin’s fatal attack,
was notoriously inferior to the task of saving his wife’s kingdom. Had
he not been so good-looking and so irresistible to Princess Sibylla, the
fall of Jerusalem might have been at least postponed.</p>

<p>Society was constructed by the crusaders on feudal lines. According
to the thirteenth century edition of the <i>Assises de la Haute Cour</i>, by
Jean d’Ibelin, Count of Jaffa, one of Godfrey’s first acts was to appoint
a commission to enquire from men of various nationalities then in
Jerusalem the usages of their respective countries. From the report of
this commission were drawn up the usages and assizes of the Kingdom
of Jerusalem, including a High Court, presided over by the King, for
the nobility; a “Court de la Borgesie,” presided over by an officer
styled the “Vicomte,” for the middle class; and a third court, under an
official, called “rays,” for the Syrians. As time went on, these usages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520"></a>[520]</span>
were modified; and, at the arrival of each large batch of new crusaders,
the King used to assemble the Patriarch and other notables at Acre,
and enquire from the newcomers about their laws, while occasionally
special missions of investigation were sent abroad. The written original
of the <i>Assises</i> was called the <i>Letres dou Sepulcre</i>, because it was
deposited in a large chest in the Holy Sepulchre; and, whenever a moot
point arose, this chest was opened in the presence of nine persons,
including the King, or his deputy, and the Patriarch, or the Prior of the
Holy Sepulchre<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>. The <i>Assizes of Jerusalem</i>, of which the <i>Assises de la
Cour des Bourgeois</i> have also been preserved, are the most endurable
monument of the Franks in Palestine, and not in Palestine alone; for
they formed the basis of the <i>Assizes of Cyprus</i>, and of the feudal organisation
of the Principality of Achaia.</p>

<p>William of Tyre expressly tells us<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> that the Counts of Tripolis were
always lieges of the King of Jerusalem. But the Princes of Antioch
(which had its own code) and the Counts of Edessa seem to have merely
recognised him as <i>primum inter pares</i> by virtue of his possession of the
Holy City, and the Princes of Antioch, beginning with Bohemond
himself, were at times reluctantly forced to confess themselves vassals
of the Greek Emperor. Thus, the existence of four practically independent
states, instead of one centralised government, and the
consequent lack of what the Italians would call a <i>fronte unico</i> against
the Infidels, formed one cause of the collapse of Frankish rule, notably
in the case of Edessa, sacrificed to the jealousy of the Prince of Antioch.
Moreover, feudal regulations impeded the exercise of the royal power.
Not only were the lieges not obliged to perform military service outside
the realm; not only had the King to consult a great council of magnates
on all important questions—for we hear of Parliaments held in the
Patriarch’s palace at Jerusalem, in a church at Acre, and at Tyre,
Nâbulus and Bethlehem—but Baldwin I was forced to revoke an
ordinance for the cleaning of the streets of Jerusalem, because he had
omitted to ask the consent of the citizens. Thus, Frankish Jerusalem
was a limited monarchy, and its King really only the first of the barons—a
system unsuited to a state of almost constant war.</p>

<p>The kingdom proper contained four great baronies—the County of
Jaffa and Ascalon, which comprised the fertile plain of Sharon; the
<i>seigneurie</i> of Krak and Montréal, which lay in the biblical land of Moab
to the east and south-east of the Dead Sea, and dominated the caravan-route
from Syria to Egypt; the Principality of Galilee, of which the
capital was Tabarie (the Tiberias of St John); and the <i>seigneurie</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521"></a>[521]</span>
Sidon, or Sagette. Besides these great baronies, upon which in turn
smaller tenures depended, it also included twelve lesser fiefs, likewise
directly dependent on the Crown, of which the most curious was that
of St Abraham, the mediæval name of Hebron, and the most important
that of Toron, founded by a member of the great crusading family of
St Omer, which succeeded Tancred in the Principality of Galilee, but
played an even more conspicuous part in Frankish Greece than in
Frankish Palestine. The romantic title of Prince of Galilee survived at
the Cypriote Court after the loss of the Holy Land; and a Lusignan
bearing that scriptural name intervened in the tortuous politics of the
Morea in the fourteenth century. Nazareth was naturally included in
the Principality of Galilee; it was the See of an Archbishop, and was
governed by a “Viscount.”</p>

<p>As in Greece, the Latin barons erected castles over the country; and
the remains of some of these, particularly Krak de Montréal and Krak
des Chevaliers, are among the finest specimens extant of mediæval
military architecture, while others, notably that of the famous family
of d’Ibelin at Beirût, were decorated with paintings and mosaics by
Syrian and Greek artists. We may infer from the description of the castle
of St Omer at Thebes in the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i>, that the subject
of these paintings may sometimes have been the Frankish Conquest of
the Holy Land, in which the baronial family had taken part.</p>

<p>Each great feudatory presided over the high court of justice of his
fief; and the <i>Assizes</i> enumerate twenty of them, besides the King and
the Archbishop of Nazareth, who possessed the right of coinage.
M. Schlumberger has published a number of these coins, among them
those of Jerusalem, bearing a representation of the Holy Sepulchre, the
Tower of David, or the Cupola of the Temple. The inscriptions on the
coins of Edessa and on some of those of Antioch are in Greek—a proof
of the preponderance of the Greek population there. Ecclesiastically,
the Latin states of Syria were organised under two Patriarchs—those
of Jerusalem and Antioch; and the first Archbishop of the kingdom was
he of Tyre, whose function it was to crown the King in the Patriarch’s
absence.</p>

<p>The Salic law did not obtain in the Holy Land; and as, by some
mysterious law of population, common also to Frankish Greece, many
noble families consisted of daughters only, women played an important
part in the crusading states. On two occasions, the election of the
Patriarch of Jerusalem (Amaury in 1159 and Heraclius in 1180) was due
to female influence, and, on the second occasion the personal predilection
of the Queen-Mother Agnes prevailed (to the great detriment of Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522"></a>[522]</span>
and State alike) over the disinterested advice of William of Tyre, who
urged the election of a candidate from beyond the sea, and recalled an
old prophecy that, as the Emperor Heraclius had brought the true cross
to Jerusalem, so in the time of another Heraclius would it be lost—a
prophecy verified at the battle of Hattin<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>. This was the Patriarch who
visited London in 1185 to seek aid from Henry II, and consecrated the
Priory of St John of Jerusalem at Clerkenwell, where a thanksgiving for
the deliverance of the Holy City was recently held.</p>

<p>The competition for the hands of noble heiresses was another result
of the extinction of families in the male line, and frequently caused
serious political complications and encouraged penniless adventurers,
like Guy de Lusignan, whose success aroused the jealousy of less
fortunate rivals. Thus, the great disaster of Hattin, which led to the
fall of Jerusalem in 1187, was indirectly due to the revenge of an Englishman,
Girard de Rideford, for his failure as a suitor. He had come to the
Holy Land as a knight-errant to make his fortune; and Count Raymond II
of Tripolis had promised him the hand of his ward, the wealthy heiress
of Boutron. A rich Pisan, however, arrived with a weighing-machine,
placed the lady (probably an opulent beauty) in one scale and his
money-bags in the other, and gave the Count her weight in gold. The
baffled Briton became a Templar and rose to be Seneschal and Master
of the Order, but never forgot how he had been cheated<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>, and persuaded
the weak monarch to reject Raymond’s strategy on the eve of Hattin.</p>

<p>An even more romantic but equally fatal example was that of
Renaud de Châtillon, who, coming to Palestine as a younger son to seek
his fortune in the suite of Louis VII of France at the time of the second
crusade, married the widowed Princess-Regent of Antioch, and governed
the Principality for his stepson. Local gossips, and especially the
Patriarch, criticised this <i>mésalliance</i>, whereupon the audacious Frenchman
had the Patriarch stripped, smeared with honey, and exposed, a
feast for the flies, during a long summer day. A born soldier of fortune,
he put his sword at the disposal of the Greek Emperor for an attack on
an Armenian baron, and when a little difference arose as to the payment
of the costs of the expedition, paid himself by ravaging the then Greek
province of Cyprus. We next find him begging the Emperor’s pardon
in his shirt-sleeves, with a rope round his neck. Then he was captured
by the Saracens in the course of a cattle-lifting expedition, and kept for
fifteen years a prisoner at Aleppo. Finding, on his liberation, that his
wife was dead and his stepson reigning at Antioch, he looked out for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523"></a>[523]</span>
a second heiress, and found one in the widowed baroness of Montréal.
There, in the land beyond Jordan, he was in his element. His next
enterprise was, indeed, a bold one. He constructed a flotilla at Krak—“the
stone of the Desert,” as it was picturesquely called—conveyed it
on camel-back to the Gulf of ʿAkaba, and sailed down into the Red Sea
with the object of plundering Mecca and Medina, and conquering the
Hedjaz and the Yemen. For this daring attempt, and for intercepting,
in time of peace, the Moslem caravan, Saladin swore twice to kill him
with his own hand. The second of these acts provoked the invasion which
led to the capture of Jerusalem, and in Saladin’s tent, as a captive after
the battle of Hattin, the adventurous Frenchman, who declared that,
to Princes, treaties were “scraps of paper,” was beheaded. His seal with
the gateway of Krak upon it still survives as a memorial of his strange
career. The love affairs of the nobles were also sometimes fatal to the
interests of the state. Thus the charms of a beautiful Armenian were
partly responsible for the loss of Edessa, and an attractive Italian widow
was a prominent figure in the last days of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The middle class was a far more important body than in either the
England or the France of that day. Palestine during the Crusades was
not visited exclusively for religious or military reasons. Besides being
a goal of pilgrimage, it was also what California or Australia was in the
middle of the last century—a place where shrewd men of business could
make money rapidly. Long before the first Crusade, there had been an
Italian colony from Amalfi at Jerusalem, in the capture of which a
Genoese detachment had assisted; colonies from Venice, Genoa, Pisa
and Marseilles followed; in the monastery of La Cava is a deed of
Baldwin IV, granting the ships of the monks access to the Syrian coast;
we even find an “English quarter” at Acre<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a>. Owing to the small
numbers of the nobility, and the constant need of recruiting its ranks
after its losses in battle, it was easy for the wealthy members of the
middle class to enter the aristocracy, while, from the nature of its
occupations, it was thrown into much closer contact with the natives.
Mixed marriages were consequently commoner among the <i>bourgeoisie</i>,
although Baldwin I and II and Josselin I of Edessa married Armenians,
and Baldwin III and Amaury I Greeks.</p>

<p>The issue of these mixed marriages was known as the <i>Poulains</i><a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>.
These half-castes, who corresponded to the Γασμοῦλοι of Frankish
Greece, are not depicted in flattering terms by contemporary writers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524"></a>[524]</span>
Jacques de Vitry<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>, the Bishop of Acre, describes them as “nourished in
delights, soft and effeminate, more accustomed to baths than to battles,
given to uncleanliness and luxury, dressed in soft garments like women,
slothful and idle, cowardly and timid, little esteemed by the Saracens,”
with whom they were ready to make peace, and from whom they were
prone to accept assistance against their fellow Christians in their
internecine quarrels. They were, alike by nature and interest, opposed
to the arrival of fresh bodies of Crusaders, because war interfered with
their business and interrupted their commercial relations with the
Moslems, whose family life they imitated, veiling their wives, shutting
them up in Oriental seclusion, and allowing them to go out thrice a week
to the baths, but only once a year to church. This undue preference of
cleanliness to godliness had disastrous effects, for it led the ladies to
intrigue all the more to get out.</p>

<p>The worthy Bishop, speaking doubtless from personal experience,
adds that the <i>Poulains</i> swindled the ingenuous pilgrims by overcharges
at inns, by exorbitant prices in shops, and by giving them poor
exchange. Worse still, they despised these Christian “boxers” and exiles,
calling them fatuous idiots for their pains—for to the <i>Poulains</i> the Holy
Land had no halo. They wore flowing robes, as even the first King of
Jerusalem had done, while a coin of Tancred of Antioch represents him
with a turban; and their whole outlook was Oriental rather than
European. Indeed, Foucher, Baldwin I’s chaplain, remarked quite early
how soon the Westerner became an Easterner in Palestine, and how the
Crusader who married an Armenian or a Syrian soon forgot the land of
his birth, adopting the comfortable maxim—“ubi bene, ibi patria.”
Hence the marked contrast between the Frankish residents, and still
more the <i>Poulains</i>, and the newly-arrived Crusaders. Hence, too, the
often far too harsh judgments passed by the latter, especially after the
second crusade in 1148. Like the Philhellenes, who went to Greece in
the War of Independence, expecting to find the Peloponnese peopled by
the superhuman heroes of Plutarch, instead of by men like themselves,
they did not realise that poor human nature, even under conditions far
more favourable, could not have possibly shone resplendent in the
tremendous setting of the Holy Land. Consequently, they were often
disillusioned, whereas men like William of Tyre, born and living in the
country, were far fairer in their judgments, because they measured the
Holy Land by the standard of other and more prosaic lands and not by
the unattainable perfection of the greatest figure in all history, with whom
it must ever be associated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525"></a>[525]</span></p>

<p>Society in the Crusading States was, it must be remembered, even
apart from the <i>Poulains</i>, an extraordinary mixture of races. Even an
Austrian army did not contain so many nationalities as the Crusaders.
The Franks, as they were generically called, included Normans (at first
the dominant race), French (who ousted the Normans, and thenceforth
maintained their influence, culture and language, as they did nearly
two centuries later at the Court of Athens), English, Welsh, Irish, Scots,
Flemings, Italians, Germans (these not very numerous), and Scandinavians.
Jacques de Vitry considered the Italians as the most satisfactory.
He describes them as “prudent, temperate in eating and drinking, ornate
and prolix in speaking, but circumspect in counsel, diligent in managing
their own public affairs, and a very necessary element in the country,
not only in battle, but at sea and in business, especially in the import
trade. Since they are sober in food and drink, they live longer than
other Western nations in the East”; and “they would be very formidable
to the Saracens, if they would cease fighting among themselves.”
Unfortunately, the rivalries between Venetians, Genoese, and Pisans
were even more serious than the feuds between the Normans and the
French; and the possession of the Church of St Saba at Acra (two pillars
of which are now outside St Mark’s Venice) led to an Italian colonial
war, in which we may find one cause of the final loss of the Holy Land.
These Italian colonies, indeed, formed practically an <i>imperium in
imperio</i>. Their respective quarters in the Syrian towns were the property
of their governments, which appointed their officials (called “Consuls”
in the Genoese and Pisan colonies, “Bailies” in the Venetian), often
from among the most celebrated families of the Venetian Republic.
Venice had also what we should call a Consul-General, a “Bailie” for
all Syria; and both she and Genoa received a large portion of the
harbour dues at Tyre and Acre. The Italian colonies had their own
tribunals, like the consular courts in Turkey in our own day. Thus,
Italian interests in the Holy Land were considerable and mainly commercial.
To Venice and Genoa foreign affairs were—the affairs of their
merchants.</p>

<p>The French and the English settlers were “less composed and more
impetuous, less circumspect in action and more full of superfluity in
food and drink, more lavish in expense and less cautious in talk, hasty
in counsel, but more fervent in almsgiving, and more vehement in battle,
and most useful for the defence of the Holy Land, and very formidable
to the Saracens.”</p>

<p>Besides these various elements among the Crusaders, Palestine
contained a large variety of indigenous races. Of these the native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526"></a>[526]</span>
Christians of Arab speech, collectively known as Syrians, were the most
favoured. Baldwin I gave them marked privileges at Jerusalem, and
they could give evidence on oath. But they were of little use in war,
except as archers; and are accused by Jacques de Vitry of betraying
the secrets of the Christians to the Saracens, whose customs they largely
imitated. The Maronites of the Lebanon were, however, noted for their
military prowess and for the help which they rendered to the Franks.</p>

<p>Next to the Syrians came the Armenians, reckoned the best fighters
of the Orientals, who, from the proximity of the Kingdom of Lesser
Armenia to the County of Edessa, often assisted the Frank Counts, and
copied their feudal arrangements. It is noticeable that the <i>Assizes of
Antioch</i> have come to us through the Armenian, and that the Court of
Sis, like that of Jerusalem, had its seneschal, its marshal, and its
constable. The Greeks were regarded as opponents of the Latins; and,
when Saladin took Jerusalem, he allowed them to remain. But we could
scarcely expect them to view with sympathy the annexation of the
Greek states of Edessa (still governed by a Greek official at the time of
the Latin conquest) and Antioch, which only fourteen years before had
been nominally a part of the Greek Empire. And Anna Comnena
describes her father’s alarm at the march of large armies of foreigners
across his rich and peaceful dominions who might (and in 1204 did)
say with the Roman centurion: <i>Hic manebimus optime!</i></p>

<p>Historians of the Moslem Arabs admit that, except in war time,
Christians and Moslems lived together in harmony. There are examples
of friendship, and even of adopted brotherhood, between Frank barons
and Moslem emirs, who used to grant each other mutual permits to
hunt. Every reader of <i>The Talisman</i> knows of the mutual courtesies
between Richard I and Saladin, who sent medical aid to a sick opponent,
but even more curious was the action of Guy de Lusignan, whose first
act, on exchanging the Kingdom of Jerusalem for that of Cyprus, was
to ask his former captor how to keep the island. Many Franks spoke
Arabic; and it was even found necessary for commercial purposes to
coin money bearing in Arabic characters the name of Mohammed and
the date of the Moslem era! The merchants of Tyre and Acre, where
these heretical coins were minted, protested that “business is business”;
but the Papal Legate, who accompanied Louis IX on the sixth crusade,
was so scandalised that he reported the matter to Pope Innocent IV,
who excommunicated all who coined them. The wily merchants,
however, circumvented his prohibition by minting similar coins with
Christian inscriptions and the year of our Lord, both in Arabic, and
with a cross in the centre of the coin. Of this hybrid currency, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527"></a>[527]</span>
began in 1251, there are several specimens. Like Frederick II in Sicily,
the later Princes of Antioch and Counts of Tripolis had Saracen guards;
and, under the name of <i>Turcoples</i>, given originally to Turks born of
Greek mothers, Moslems entered the Christian armies as light cavalry.
Of actual Turks there were few, for they had overrun Syria too short
a time before the Crusades to take root in Palestine. Like the Franks,
and like the Turks in the Balkans, they were only a garrison.</p>

<p>Special interest attaches to the Jews, at this period only a small
section of the population, and, as usual, exclusively urban. Benjamin
of Tudela, who visited Palestine about 1173, found two hundred Jews
in the ghetto at Jerusalem beneath the Tower of David, where they had
a monopoly of the dyeing trade, and twelve, all dyers, at Bethlehem.
The largest Jewish colonies were, as was natural, in the great commercial
towns, Tyre and Acre; and the total in the whole of the Latin states was
only 7000 to 8000. They could not hold land, and were classed below the
Moslems, but practised successfully as doctors and bankers, and had
their own judges. Many had come from the south of France. A few
Samaritans still survived at Nâbulus, the biblical Shechem, and at
Cæsarea.</p>

<p>Below all these freemen came the slaves, including Christians, partly
prisoners of war and partly imported. The <i>Assizes of Jerusalem</i> contain
special regulations for the slave-trade (largely in Venetian and Genoese
hands), but the legislators felt some scruples about allowing a Christian
slave to be sold to a Moslem. There was one other very undesirable
element in the population—persons who had left their country for their
country’s good; for it was not unusual to pardon criminals on condition
that they made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and never returned. The
Bishop of Acre complains of this practice of making the Holy Land a
convict station, just as some of our colonies did in the first half of the
last century; and he quotes the Horatian tag, that people, who cross
the sea, change the climate, but not their character. Nor does he
approve of the tourist, who came from mere curiosity and not from
devotion.</p>

<p>Among this heterogeneous mass the smallness of the Frankish forces
makes us marvel that the Latin Kingdom lasted for 99 years at Jerusalem
and for nearly 200 at Acre. The <i>Assizes</i><a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> inform us that the paper strength
of the royal army was only 577 knights and 5025 foot-soldiers, to which
we must add the contingents of the two great Military Orders and the
<i>Turcoples</i>. At no time, in actual warfare, did the total armed forces of
the four Crusading States much exceed 25,000; at Hattin—the Hastings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528"></a>[528]</span>
of the Holy Land—Guy de Lusignan had only some 21,000 men under
his command; Baldwin I crossed the Euphrates with only 80 knights
to take Edessa; and some of the great battles of Tancred were fought
by only 200 knights. William of Tyre<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a>, writing a few years before the
catastrophe of 1187, explains the greater success of the Franks in the
earlier years of the kingdom by their piety and courage as contrasted
with the immorality and diminished martial spirit of his contemporaries.
Other causes were the lack of military skill of the Moslems of that
generation, and the disunion of their chiefs. When, however, Saladin
united Syria and Egypt in his strong hand, the fate of the little Frankish
colony was sealed. Disunion of allies neutralised the splendid courage
of our Richard I in his attempt to restore what had been lost; Frederick II
was a Crusader <i>malgré lui</i>; and in the thirteenth century many Franks,
realising that the end was at hand, left for the Lusignan Kingdom of
Cyprus, or for Armenia, leaving as the most important factors in the
Latin population the Italian colonies and the Religious Orders.</p>

<p>The Knights of St John, who originally took their name from St John
the Merciful<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>, a Cypriote who became Patriarch of Alexandria, arose
at the time of the conquest in connection with the hospital, founded at
Jerusalem a generation earlier by a citizen of Amalfi. Their first aim was
to tend and nourish the sick, then to guard pilgrims up from the coast,
and next to fight against the Infidels. They never forgot their original
object, and pilgrims were enthusiastic in their praise. Indeed, Saladin
is said to have gained admission to their hospital at Acre as a patient
to see whether all that he heard about their beneficence was true.
Gradually, as the feudal barons found it harder to defend their castles,
they handed them to the Knights, who specially chose difficult frontier
positions. Margat, Krak des Chevaliers, Chastel-Rouge, Gibelin and
Belvoir were their chief fortresses; and Mount Tabor was one of their
possessions.</p>

<p>The Templars, founded in 1118 to protect the pilgrims on their way
from the coast, enjoyed a less enviable reputation. William of Tyre<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a>
remarks, that “for a long time they maintained their original object,
but subsequently forgot the duty of humility.” They were accused of
greed and selfishness, and of being too anxious to stand well with Moslem
Princes, with whom they sometimes made a separate peace, to the
detriment of Christendom. Thus they warned a Moslem chief of an
intended raid by our Prince Edward. Their treachery to the sect of the
Assassins scandalised the Court of Jerusalem and immensely damaged
Christian interests. The chief of that terrible community, the “Old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529"></a>[529]</span>
Man,” as he was called, whose territory was separated from the County
of Tripolis by boundary stones, marked on the Christian side with a cross,
on that of the Assassins with a knife, had sent an envoy to King Amaury I,
offering to embrace Christianity, on condition that the Templars
consented to forego the tribute paid to them by the Assassins. All had
been arranged, and the diplomatist was on his way home, when the
Templars assassinated the Assassin<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>.</p>

<p>The Templars’ vow of poverty contrasted ill with their immense
wealth, which enabled them, in 1191, to buy Cyprus from Richard I,
and to lend a large sum to our Henry III. They acted as bankers; and
through their hands passed the money collected in the West for future
crusades. They were suspected, too, of heretical opinions, and were
accused of initiating their novices with pagan rites. They possessed
eighteen fortresses, of which Tortosa was the most important; but the
Order did not long survive the loss of the Holy Land, being abolished
by Clement V in 1312.</p>

<p>Less important were the Teutonic Knights, the <i>Brüder vom deutschen
Hause</i> of Freytag’s well-known historical novel—an off-shoot of the
Hospitallers—because the Germans contributed little towards the
foundation of the Frankish states, and their distinct Order was not
founded till after the first capture of the Latin capital. Their principal
sphere of activity was not in Palestine but in Prussia, where they
laboured to civilise the barbarous Prussians—a task in which they do
not appear to have been altogether successful. A lasting memorial of
their activity is the former Prussian fortress of Thorn—a name said to be
derived from the castle of Toron in the Holy Land, once their possession.
To us a more interesting Order is that of the Hospital of “the Master
and Brothers of St Thomas of Canterbury,” at Acre, founded in 1191,
in which Edward I showed interest, and which was transferred after the
fall of Acre to Cyprus, where it still existed in 1350. A hospital for poor
British pilgrims was also founded at Acre in 1254<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>.</p>

<p>Palestine was a fruitful land during the Frankish period, although
we hear much of the plagues of locusts and field-mice. Contemporary
visitors wrote enthusiastically about the gardens of Jericho and the
fertile plains of Jezreel and Tripolis, with its vineyards, its olive-yards,
and its sugar plantations, whence the cane was taken to the factory at
Tyre. The wines of Engaddi were as noted as in the Song of Solomon;
and the vintages of Bethlehem and Jerusalem were highly esteemed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530"></a>[530]</span>
Jericho produced grapes so huge that “a man could scarcely lift a bunch
of them”—a statement which shows that the vines had not degenerated
since the days when the spies of Moses “cut down” from the brook of
Eschcol “one cluster of grapes, and bare it between two upon a staff.”
Even the silent waters of the Dead Sea were then traversed by fruit
barges; and in the so-called “Valley of Moses” to the south of it the
olive-trees formed “a dense forest.” There was more wood than now, and
consequently more water, but corn had to be imported, for the harvests
of Moab, Hebron, Bethlehem (“the house of bread”), and Jericho did
not suffice to feed the population. The Sea of Galilee was as full of fish
as in the time of Our Lord, and boats plied upon its waters. But, owing
to the general insecurity of the open country, few of the cultivators of
the soil were Franks; and, where we find Latin peasants, they are usually
not far from the shelter of fortified towns. Of manufactures the most
important were those of silk at Tripolis, Tiberias, and Tyre, dyeing, and
pottery; the glass of Tyre is specially praised by its Archbishop, and the
goldsmiths had a street all to themselves at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Civilisation, so far as comfort was concerned, had reached a high
level. Every castle had its baths; and minstrels and dancers appeared
at the entertainments of the barons, while we read of theatrical performances
at a coronation. A considerable amount of gambling went
on in royal circles. Baldwin III was devoted to dice; the Prince of
Antioch and the Count of Edessa were so busy with their dice-boxes
during a campaign, that they demoralised many of their officers; the
Count of Jaffa was so deeply engrossed in a game of dice that he was
playing in the street of the Tanners at Jerusalem, that he allowed
himself to be assassinated. Hunting with the falcon, and, in Arab
fashion, with the cat-like animal known as the <i>carable</i>, were favourite
amusements. It seems strange that nothing was done to encourage
horse-breeding; and, as the Moslems were loth to sell horses to be used
against themselves, the Franks usually imported their steeds from
Apulia. Every spring it was the custom of the Frankish chivalry to take
their horses to feed on the rich grass at the foot of Mt Carmel; and there,
by the brook Kishon, where Elijah slew the prophets of Baal, tournaments
were held, in which Saracen chiefs sometimes took part, and after
which the combatants refreshed themselves with sherbet, made from
the snows of Lebanon.</p>

<p>We must not expect a military colony, always fighting for its
existence, to be very productive of literature. But perhaps the best
specimen of mediæval history, the great work of William of Tyre, was
produced by a Frank born in the Holy Land. The author possessed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531"></a>[531]</span>
two greatest qualities for writing the history of his own times: personal
acquaintance with the principal actors in the drama by reason of his
high official position, and at the same time fearless love of truth. He
tells us that he was well aware of the perils to which he thus exposed
himself; and, if it be true that he was poisoned in Rome by order of a
rival whom he had denounced, his forebodings were only too accurate.
Having been a diplomatist, a prelate, a royal tutor, and chancellor of
the kingdom, he possessed an unrivalled experience of men and affairs;
and, as is usual with such persons, he was much more moderate in his
judgments of human frailty than purely literary or monastic chroniclers.
The abrupt close of his work in 1183 has been ascribed to the desire of
powerful enemies to suppress the facts about the last years of Jerusalem—a
further proof of his dreaded influence.</p>

<p>A lesser luminary was Renaud, baron of Sagette, who amazed the
pundits of Saladin by his Oriental scholarship; and the cult of French
novels was diffused among the nobles of the Holy Land, whose legal
knowledge was considerable. Philip of Navarre<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>, the celebrated pleader,
who has left a treatise showing how to make the worse cause appear the
better in the feudal courts, tells us that he owed his knowledge of legal
practice to the accident of being appointed reader of romances to the
Seneschal of Jerusalem, who in return taught him law. The pleader, who
also composed a historical work, and a treatise on the four ages of man,
and was an opponent of the higher education of women, is described
by Florio Bustron, the Cypriote historian, as a “huomo universale.”</p>

<p>In estimating the architectural results of the Frankish rule, we must
remember the short time available—so far as all but the coast towns were
concerned. But a traveller, who visited the country in 1185, tells us
that the Franks had done much for the mural decoration of their
churches, of which, beginning with Tancred’s church on Mt Tabor in
1111, they erected a number down to the catastrophe of Hattin. William
of Tyre specially mentions the munificence of Queen Mélisende in
founding a church and convent at Bethany, of which her youngest sister
was Superior, and her splendidly bound copy of the Gospels is in the
British Museum. In the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and in the
Cathedral and Castle of Tortosa, still linger traces of the Crusaders. It
has been remarked that in their architecture more than in aught else
the Franks of Palestine remained Westerners.</p>

<p>In conclusion we may ask how Frankish society in Palestine compares
with Frankish society in Cyprus and in the Latin Principalities of the
present Greek Kingdom. Very different from either Frankish Palestine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532"></a>[532]</span>
or Frankish Greece was the condition of the Kingdom of Cyprus, created
by a mere accident of the Crusades, which nominally continued the
tradition of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. While the reason of the latter’s
existence was war, Cyprus was essentially a commercial state, to which
the loss of Acre was a blessing in disguise. So long as the Kings of Cyprus,
in their capacity of Kings of Jerusalem, had territory on the opposite
coast of Syria, they were necessarily involved in continental wars, and
could not devote themselves to the development of their own island;
as was the case of the Kings of England, so long as they held the <i>damnosa
hereditas</i> of the Plantagenets in France. Cyprus was, like England,
defended by the sea; like England, she became one of the marts of the
world, in an age when the crusading spirit had died away, and trade was
the attraction that led men to the East. The Popes, by prohibiting trade
with the Saracens after the loss of the Holy Land, procured for Cyprus
a monopoly; and Famagosta surpassed Constantinople, Venice and
Alexandria. Moreover, warned by the example of Jerusalem, the Kings
of Cyprus cut down the privileges of the nobles, who were denied the
right of coinage and jurisdiction over the middle class. Consequently,
the Cypriote monarchy was more independent, and continued to prosper
until it allowed—and this should be to us a warning—foreign competitors,
under the guise of commerce, to creep into its cities and
ultimately to dictate its policy.</p>

<p>All the Latin states in the East, whether in Jerusalem, Cyprus, or
Greece proper, presented examples of that difficult political experiment—the
rule of a small alien minority over a large native majority of a
different religion, an experiment worked most successfully in those
states, like Lesbos under the Genoese Gattilusj, where the Latin rulers
became assimilated with the ruled. But in Frankish Greece the feudal
states were not commercial; and the Venetian and Genoese colonies
were, except in Negroponte, quite distinct from them. The Frank
conquerors of Greece did not go thither with the noble aims which led
some of the leaders of the first Crusade to the Holy Land; on the
contrary, they turned aside from the recovery of the Holy City to
partition a Christian Empire. Yet the moral standard of the Franks
in Greece was much higher than that of their predecessors in Palestine,
or their contemporaries in Cyprus. Possibly, the reason was that they
lived healthier lives, and had fewer temptations. Big maritime
commercial towns, like Tyre and Acre, and Famagosta, did not exist,
and country life was more developed. Certainly, the <i>Chronicle of the
Morea</i> is more edifying reading than the <i>Letters</i> of Jacques de Vitry
on the condition of Acre at the time of his appointment as its bishop in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533"></a>[533]</span>
1216. But in one respect Frankish Palestine and Frankish Greece
present the same strange phenomenon—that union of antiquity with
the Middle Ages, of the biblical and the classical with the romantic,
which inspired the second part of <i>Faust</i>. To find the feudal system
installed at Hebron and Athens, at Shechem and Sparta, at Tiberias
and Thebes, to read of Princes of Galilee and of Princes of Achaia, causes
surprise only surpassed by that which we should have felt in August,
1914, had we been told that before four Christmases had passed,
Australians and New Zealanders would have shared in the taking of
Jerusalem.</p>

<h3 id="heading28">6. A BYZANTINE BLUE STOCKING: ANNA COMNENA</h3>

<p>One of the differences between classical and modern literature is the
rarity of female writers in the former and their frequency in the latter.
While we have lady historians and poets in considerable numbers, while
the fair sex has greatly distinguished itself in fiction, including that
branch of it which is called modern journalism, ancient Greek letters
contain the names of few celebrated women except Sappho; Myrtis and
Corinna, the competitors of Pindar; Erinna, whose poetic fancy her
mother strove to restrain by chaining her to her neglected spinning-wheel;
and Elephantis, whose poetry was considered too realistic for
display upon drawing-room tables. Novels were in those days chiefly
written by bishops—a class of men not now usually associated with
light literature. In Latin literature, although Juvenal has drawn a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534"></a>[534]</span>
picture of the learned lady weighing in the critical balance the respective
claims of Homer and Virgil, the poem attributed to Sulpicia is almost
the sole surviving example of female composition. It has been reserved
for Byzantine literature to present us with the rare phenomenon of a
first-class lady historian—first-class, that is to say, according to the
standards of that day—in the person of the Imperial Princess, Anna
Comnena, a writer better known to the general public than are most
Byzantine authors owing to the fact that Sir Walter Scott introduced
her as one of the characters in <i>Count Robert of Paris</i>, and based one of
the chief episodes of that novel upon a historical event recorded in her
life of her father.</p>

<p>Since Scott’s time, novelists and dramatists have done something
to popularise Byzantine history. Neale, in his <i>Theodora Phranza</i>,
daughter of the last Byzantine historian, has described the capture of
Constantinople by the Turks; Sardou produced on the stage a far more
famous Theodora, the consort of Justinian, whom Prokopios so virulently
besmirched in his <i>Secret History</i>. Mr Frederic Harrison has portrayed
in <i>Theophano</i> the ambitious and unscrupulous wife and widow of the
Emperors Romanos II and Nikephoros Phokas. Jean Lombard in
<i>Byzance</i> depicted, with immense erudition, the games and ceremonial
of the Imperial city and court in the time of the Iconoclast Emperor,
Constantine V Copronymos, and endeavoured to solve the Balkan
question by marrying and placing on the throne the Slav Oupravda and
the Greek Eustokkia; while Marion Crawford gave us in <i>Arethusa</i> a
story from a much later period, the year 1376, based upon the struggle
at the Court of John V between the Venetian adventurer, Carlo Zeno,
and the Genoese, for the possession of the isle of Tenedos, the key of the
Dardanelles.</p>

<p>Anna Comnena was born in 1083 at an interesting moment in the
history not only of the Greek Empire, but of Christendom. It was the
time when the Mediæval West and the Mediæval East first met; when
the Normans, after their recent conquest of England and Southern Italy,
first crossed the Adriatic and Ionian seas to attack the Greek Empire,
soon to be followed by the hosts of the First Crusade. Just as, with the
accession of William the Conqueror fifteen years earlier, a new order of
things had begun in Northern Europe, so with the accession of her
father, the Emperor Alexios I Comnenos, in 1081, two years before her
birth, a new era, and practically a new dynasty—though Alexios was
not the first of the family to seize the throne—had begun at Byzantium.
From 1025, the end of the long and glorious reign of Basil II, whom the
Greeks of to-day still admire as the “Bulgar-slayer,” the destroyer of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535"></a>[535]</span>
the first Bulgarian Empire on those self-same battlefields of Macedonia
where King Constantine defeated the Bulgarians in the second Balkan
war of 1913, the Byzantine throne had been occupied by no less than
twelve sovereigns, whose consecutive reigns filled a period scarcely
longer than that embraced by the single reign of the great Basil. After
the death of his brother and successor, Constantine VIII, there began
a period of palace intrigues and female influence, for Constantine’s
two mature daughters, Zoe and Theodora, assigned the throne to
whomsoever they chose; and the successive marriages of the elderly Zoe
furnished Psellos with a <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> of the Imperial Court and
boudoir, and MM. Schlumberger and Diehl with their brilliant modern
paraphrases of the contemporary writer. When, with the death of
Theodora, the Macedonian dynasty came to an end in the person of its
last representative, revolution succeeded revolution. Every general of
aristocratic birth was justified in believing that he carried in his baggage
the red boots which were the peculiar mark of the Imperial dignity,
and a female regency enabled the Empress Eudokia to bestow the
Empire with her hand. At last, the ablest and astutest of the Byzantine
commanders, Alexios Comnenos, deposed the feeble old voluptuary,
Nikephoros Botaneiates, whose Slavonic ministers had discredited his
authority by their “barbarous” pronunciation and foreign origin, and
placed himself and his descendants upon the throne for 100 years.</p>

<p>These internal dissensions had naturally injured the external
prestige of the Empire and contracted its frontiers. It was then that
there came the final separation between the Eastern and the Western
Churches; it was then, too, that, by the loss of Bari, Brindisi, and
Otranto, the Byzantine Empire forfeited its last Italian possessions.
Meanwhile, the advance of the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor had pushed
back the Greek frontier in a second continent close to the capital; and
Anna Comnena<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> declares that, on her father’s accession, “the Bosporus
was the eastern, and Adrianople the western, limit of the Greek sceptre.”
Alexios, she proudly adds, “widened the circle of the Empire, and made
the Adriatic its western, the Euphrates and the Tigris its eastern,
border.”</p>

<p>Yet, as she truly says, her father had to contend all the time against
enormous difficulties, alike domestic and foreign. At the outset of his
reign, his throne was surrounded with possible pretenders. Both his
immediate predecessors were alive, although the one was a bishop, the
other in a monastery, besides four sons of dethroned Emperors who had
received the Imperial title during their fathers’ reigns, and several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536"></a>[536]</span>
persons who had endeavoured unsuccessfully to seize and keep the
crown. There were constant conspiracies against Alexios so long as he
sat on the throne, while the eternal theological questions, which were
the favourite mental distraction of Byzantium, caused him constant
anxiety, for there, as in the Balkans to-day, theology and politics were
inextricably mingled. From abroad there came, too, the menace of
invasion on all sides—from the wild tribes of the Patzinaks and Cumans
on the north, from the Normans on the west, from the Turks on the
east. And, worse than all, the unhappy Alexios was suddenly called
upon to cope with the hurricane of the First Crusade, and to find his
Empire overrun by swarms of fierce warriors, whose motives he suspected
and whose intentions he judged from their acts to be predatory.</p>

<p>Alexios owed his crown to a successful insurrection; but he was no
vulgar upstart. He belonged to a rich family of Paphlagonia, where the
Comnenoi held property at Kastamon, the modern Kastamouni, the place
known in contemporary history as the exile for nearly thirty years of
the late Mirdite Prince, Prenk Bib Doda. The Comnenoi had first come
into prominence about a century earlier under Basil II; and one of the
clan, the distinguished general, Isaac Comnenos, had occupied the
throne from 1057 to 1059. Anna’s father was this man’s nephew, and,
in spite of his uncle’s brief reign, the real founder of the dynasty. For
the Emperor Isaac, in a moment of discouragement and disillusionment,
not only abdicated but failed to induce his brother John, the father of
Alexios, to accept the heavy burden of the crown. It was not, however,
to his timorous and unambitious father, but to his energetic mother,
Anna Dalassene, that Alexios owed his success. She was resolved that
her son should be Emperor, and during four intervening reigns, she was
waiting and intriguing for the diadem which her husband had allowed
to go out of his family. A great lady herself, the daughter of an eminent
official and soldier, whose skill in never failing to kill his man had earned
him the nickname of “Charon,” she belonged, like the Comnenoi, to a
powerful Asiatic family, one of whose members had been at first thought
by Constantine VIII as worthy to succeed him, and had subsequently
been regarded as a possible husband for the old Empress Zoe. Like
many eminent Byzantine personages, she had known the reverses of
fortune, and had at one time been exiled to Prinkipo. Such was the
esteem which the Emperor Alexios felt for the mother, who had
constantly encouraged and facilitated his ambition, that when, at the
outset of his reign, he was compelled to leave his capital to fight against
the Normans in Albania, he entrusted to her the absolute authority over
the Empire during his absence. This is only one of many instances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537"></a>[537]</span>
proving the influence of women in the Byzantine system. Thus, the
mother of Alexios made history, his daughter wrote it; his mother made
him Emperor, his daughter preserved the memory of his reign. Such
were the origin and parents of the hero of the <i>Alexiad</i>. Let us now look
at its author.</p>

<p>The literary Princess has given us in her history of her father a
considerable amount of autobiographical information. Anna Comnena
was not at all disposed to hide her light under a bushel, nor did she ever
forget that she had been born in the purple chamber—the room to
which an Empress was always removed when her confinement was
imminent. Like most members of the reigning Imperial family, she
received an excellent literary education. “I am not destitute of letters,”
she writes in her preface, “but have thoroughly studied classical Greek”;
and she adds that she had applied herself diligently to the mathematical
quadrivium, to rhetoric, the philosophy of Aristotle, and the dialogues
of Plato. In another passage she alludes to her knowledge of geometry.
Her quotations show a wide range of reading. Her history contains
citations from, or allusions to, Homer, Sappho, Sophokles, Euripides,
Aristophanes, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,
the <i>Tactics</i> of Ælian, and the astronomer Eudoxos, while she repeats
a whole sentence from Polybios and another from John of Epiphania,
and shows, as Byzantine writers always do, great familiarity with the
Bible. Niketas summed her up as “acquainted with every art.”</p>

<p>Nor need we, who have in our own history a similarly learned lady of
royal lineage, Lady Jane Grey, wonder at the erudition of this Byzantine
blue stocking. There had been a recrudescence of literary culture in the
eleventh century at Byzantium<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>, as in the sixteenth century in London.
Shortly before Anna’s birth the Imperial Court had been the scene of
the many-sided activities of that remarkable man, Michael Psellos, “the
Prince of Philosophers,” as he was called by his contemporaries, the
Voltaire of mediæval Greek literature, at once philosopher, historian,
lawyer, monk, courtier and prime minister, who demonstrated, as other
learned statesmen have proved in our own time, that great intellectual
attainments may coincide with a poor character and political ineptitude.
Another writer, the historian Michael of Adalia, or Attaleiates, who had
gained by his legal abilities the favour of successive sovereigns, dedicated
his history of his own time to the Emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates, and
made a sufficient fortune out of speculations in real estate to found an
almshouse for his less fortunate fellows. But in the time of Psellos and
Attaleiates learning had disciples on the throne, as well as in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538"></a>[538]</span>
lecture-hall. The Imperial family of Doukas was noted for its devotion
to literature; the collection of genealogies of gods and heroes, known
under the title of <i>Ionia</i> (or <i>Violarium</i>), has been by some ascribed
to the ambitious Empress Eudokia, wife of Constantine X Doukas and
of his successor; while the Emperor Michael VII Doukas, who had been
a pupil of Psellos and is known in history by the nickname of “Parapinakes,”
or the “Peck-filcher,” from his fraudulent manipulation of the
corn-monopoly, spent his time in composing iambics and anapæsts quite
in the fashion of our classically-educated eighteenth century statesmen,
who lost us the American colonies and were stronger at Greek verses
than at political economy. Even the old <i>roué</i> Botaneiates, was, if we
believe his panegyrist Attaleiates, a lover of books. When Alexios
succeeded him, he further encouraged literature; one of his physicians,
Kallikles, was a writer of epitaphs, not always on his own patients; and
the historian, John Skylitzes, who was a captain of the bodyguard,
dedicated some legal treatises to this Emperor.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, remarkable that Alexios’ daughter was highly
educated, nor that her husband, Nikephoros Bryennios, was, like herself,
a historian, although, like Julius Cæsar, he modestly described his work
as merely supplying “the materials for those who wished to write
history.” A soldier by profession, the son of the pretender of the same
name who had revolted against Michael VII, and had been crushed by
Alexios, he defended Constantinople against Godfrey of Bouillon in
1097, and fought against the Sultan of Ikonium in 1116. Taking
Xenophon, another literary soldier, as his model, he possessed, like
Attaleiates, a much simpler and more straightforward style than his
learned consort, and his soldierly prose is, although a glorification of his
father-in-law, pleasing to read.</p>

<p>But the cultured Anna, unlike her husband, had other besides
literary ambitions, of which her distracted account of her father’s
death-bed shows no trace. We learn, however, from the later historian,
Niketas, of the mundane designs which agitated the bosoms of the
Empress and her daughter at that solemn moment, of the efforts made
by Irene to induce her expiring husband to disinherit his son in favour
of his son-in-law, and how, when the dying Emperor lifted up his hands
to heaven with a forced smile on his pallid cheeks, his wife bitterly
reproached him with the words: “Husband, all thy life thou hast been
versed in every kind of deceit, saying one thing and thinking another;
and now that thou art dying, thou art true to thine old ways.” Gibbon
has summed up the remark in the caustic sarcasm: “You die as you have
lived—a hypocrite.” Nor was the virtuous Anna inclined to acquiesce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539"></a>[539]</span>
in the accession of her brother John II. She had been, till his birth, the
heiress-presumptive, and as such had been betrothed as a child to the
son of the dethroned Emperor, Michael VII, the young Constantine
Doukas, who died, however, before their marriage. She had thus missed
the throne once, and was determined not to miss it again.</p>

<p>Scott, in his novel, has completely misrepresented the character of
her husband by representing him as plotting to seize the throne, even
during the lifetime of Alexios. Such a conception of the honest Bryennios
is quite erroneous. For Anna’s plot was entirely frustrated by the
sluggish indifference and greater humanity of her consort. So greatly
annoyed was his wife at his reluctance to accept the crown by killing
or blinding his brother-in-law, that she bitterly reproached nature in a
phrase which must be left in the obscurity of the original language, for
having made the mistake of creating her a woman and him a man. The
conspiracy was discovered; but the Emperor treated his sister with more
mercy than she deserved, contenting himself with bestowing her richly
furnished palace upon his favourite and faithful minister. Even this
punishment, at the instance of the minister himself, was rescinded; her
palace was restored to the princess; her husband held office under the
new Emperor and accompanied him in the Syrian campaign of 1137;
but her pride was wounded by her brother’s magnanimity. She retired
in Byzantine fashion to the convent of Our Lady of Grace, founded by
her mother, the ex-Empress Irene, whose charter has been preserved.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty-five her career at Court was over; her old friends,
courtier-like, turned away from her to worship the rising sun; her mother,
her favourite brother, her husband, whom, despite his weakness of character
and unwillingness to reign, she loudly praises in her history and
regarded with obvious affection<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>, successively passed away. Their son,
Alexios, who took his mother’s surname, held office under her nephew,
the Emperor Manuel, as Lord High Admiral. She bitterly complains,
with her customary rhetorical exaggeration, of her hard lot since her
eighth year, when her brother John was associated with his father in
the Imperial dignity; to enumerate her sufferings and her enemies, she
exclaims, “requires the Siren eloquence of Isokrates, the deep voice of
Pindar, the vehemence of Polemon, the muse of Homer, the lyre of
Sappho.” For twenty-nine years she had not seen or spoken with any
of her father’s friends, of whom many were dead, and many were afraid
to visit her. She compares herself with Niobe, and introduces into her
history transparent allusions to her treatment by “the great,” and to
the folly of her father’s successors—both monarchs of distinction<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540"></a>[540]</span>
Under these circumstances, she endeavoured to console herself with the
composition of her history—a work written mostly, as she tells us, under
the reign of her nephew, Manuel I, who ascended the throne in 1143.
By 1148, at the age of 65, she had finished her work; the date of her
death is unknown.</p>

<p>The princess had set herself the filial task of writing a biography of
her father from 1069 to his death in 1118, thus covering the whole of
his reign and twelve years before it. Her history thus formed a continuation
of those composed by Attaleiates and by her husband, the
former of whom had narrated the events of the years 1034 to 1079, the
latter those of the years 1070 to 1079. As it had been the object of
the former to glorify the still living Botaneiates, so it was the aim of the
latter to whitewash Alexios, representing him as a legitimate sovereign,
who had merely renounced the throne, once occupied by his uncle.</p>

<p>She begins her history by describing her father’s exploits during
the three previous reigns, the “three labours of Hercules<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>,” as she
characteristically calls his suppression of the rebellions of Oursel Bailleul,
or Russell Balliol, a member of the family which founded Balliol College
(whom Scott has, by a pardonable anachronism, represented as a fellow-prisoner
of Count Robert of Paris in the dungeon), and his victory over
the two pretenders from Durazzo, her husband’s father, Nikephoros
Bryennios, and Basilakios. She then proceeds to trace the career of the
famous Norman leader, Robert Guiscard, and the causes of his war
against the Byzantine Empire, the first attack of the Latin West against
the Greek East and the forerunner of the Fourth Crusade. The second
book is devoted to her father’s revolt against the Emperor Nikephoros
Botaneiates and his seizure of the throne. With the third book begins
his reign. She describes the Norman invasion, how Guiscard crossed the
Adriatic, besieged and took Durazzo, the historic town which has played
so large a part in the Balkan history of the last seven years, and which
was then the western gate of the Byzantine Empire, just as in the days
of Catullus and Plautus it had been the “tavern of the Adriatic.” In
the sixth book we have Guiscard’s second expedition and death at the
Cephalonian village, which, under the name of Phiskardo, still recalls
the end of that famous Norman leader. Here is related the legend that
in the opposite island of Ithake there was a ruined city, called Jerusalem;
and thus was fulfilled the prophesy that Guiscard should die when he
had reached Jerusalem. Similar prophecies were similarly accomplished
in the case of Pope Silvester II, who died after celebrating mass in the
Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and in that of our King Henry IV,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541"></a>[541]</span>
dying, as Shakespeare has narrated, in the Jerusalem chamber. Next
follow the military operations in Asia Minor and against the Cumans, or
“Scythians,” as the classically-educated writer calls them, in Europe.
Then, after some account of the affairs of Crete and Cyprus and of the
Dalmatian revolt, the tenth book treats of the heresy of Neilos, and
introduces us to the First Crusade.</p>

<p>At this point the chief interest of this history for modern readers
begins, for Anna Comnena is writing of a movement of world-wide
importance, and her descriptions of the Crusading chiefs are those of an
eyewitness. The eleventh book deals with the progress of the Crusaders
in Asia—the capture of Nice, the foundation of the Principality of
Antioch and of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the accession of Baldwin I,
the quarrel of Alexios and Bohemond about Antioch and Laodicea, and
Bohemond’s strangely contrived journey to Italy in a coffin with the
odorous carcase of a dead cock. Books twelve and thirteen describe his
second invasion of Albania, his siege of Durazzo, and his second pact of
vassalage with Alexios, who gave him Antioch as a fief for life with the
County of Edessa. The fourteenth book records his death, the siege of
Tyre and the Turkish war, and gives an interesting account of the
Bogomile heretics at Philippopolis. The last book is also partly occupied
with their treatment by the Emperor, and ends with a somewhat
mutilated description of the death of Alexios. Thus, as a later Greek
epigram expressed it, the <i>Alexiad</i> ended when Alexios died.</p>

<p>As its name implies, the <i>Alexiad</i> is a biography rather than a history,
with the Emperor as the central figure, placed in what his admiring
daughter regarded as the most favourable light, but what, according to
modern ideas, is sometimes quite the reverse. The Imperial biographer
was well aware that she would be accused of partiality, and is at
considerable pains to repudiate in advance the charge of filial prejudice.
She specially pleads her unbiased judgment in dealing with her father’s
career, declares that she does not like to praise her relatives or to repeat
scandal, adapts Aristotle’s famous saying about Plato by averring that,
if her father is dear to her, truth is dearer, and sums up her aim as
“love of her father and love of truth<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>.” She admits that he had some
defects, that he stammered<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> and found difficulty in pronouncing the
letter R; and she candidly avows that he was merely an instrument in
the hand of his mother, Anna Dalassene, an excellent woman of business,
when he first ascended the throne<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>. But she is apt to forget her precept
of impartiality when she comes to describe his achievements. With
characteristic exaggeration she exclaims that, “not even if another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542"></a>[542]</span>
Demosthenes and all the chorus of the orators, not even if all the Academy
and all the Stoic philosophers combined together to extol the services of
Alexios, could they attain unto them”; and in another passage she asks,
“what echo of Demosthenes or whirling words of Polemon, why, not all
the muses of Homer, could worthily hymn his successes; I should say
that not Plato himself, nor all the Porch and Academy combined
together could have philosophised in a manner such as befitted his
soul<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>.”</p>

<p>She tells us that her father hated not only lying but the appearance
of lying; yet, she naïvely applauds his sharp practice in sending letters
to Bohemond’s officers, in which he thanked them for letters to himself
which they had never written, in order to compromise them with their
chief; she acknowledges without a blush how he deceived the Crusaders
at the taking of Nice; and she describes with admiration how he invited
the Bogomile heretic, Basil, to a private colloquy, telling him that he
admired his virtue and urging him to make a full statement of his
doctrine, while all the time a secretary, concealed behind a curtain, took
down the statements which fell from the unsuspecting heresiarch’s
mouth and which were used as evidence against him to send him to the
stake. Such tactics only evoke from the complaisant daughter the
laudatory comment, that her father’s theological skill in dealing with
heretics like the Manichæans should earn him the title of “the thirteenth
apostle<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>.” Modern readers will agree with Finlay that “even Anna’s
account makes the Bogomilian a noble enthusiast, and her father a mean
traitor.”</p>

<p>Yet Alexios was, in spite of these moral defects, a brave soldier, who,
however, usually followed the plan of gaining a victory by craft, if craft
were possible. His character was a combination, not uncommon in the
Near East, of courage and intrigue; he was no coward, but he was a born
schemer, rather than a statesman. Like many Byzantine rulers, he had
a weakness for theology—a dangerous taste in an autocrat—and his
daughter describes with admiration how he lectured the heretic Neilos
on the doctrine of the Trinity, and how he ordered a monk named
Zygavenos to compile a list and refutation of all the heresies, under the
title of “A Dogmatic Panoply.” He had the politician’s love for an
immediate success, rather than for a lasting benefit, although he was,
as his daughter tells us, fond of playing chess, in which immediate
success counts for less than a far-seeing plan. Thus, to obtain the
temporary advantage of securing the aid of the Venetian fleet against
the Normans, he gave the Venetians enormous commercial concessions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543"></a>[543]</span>
throughout his Empire, which were one of the causes, 120 years later,
of the Latin capture of Constantinople. The policy of Alexios Comnenos
has had disciples in Southern and South-Eastern Europe in our own
day; but the most successful Greek statesman of our time attained his
wonderful triumphs by frankness and honesty of purpose, to which the
Byzantine Emperor was a stranger.</p>

<p>But Anna’s partiality is not limited to her father; it extends to
other members of her family, except, of course, her brother, the Emperor
John II, who was, in reality, an excellent sovereign. Although she
despised her husband’s weakness in not seizing the throne, she praises
in Homeric language his skill as an archer, and devotes a long passage
to the learning and wisdom, the strength and physical beauty, which
made “my Cæsar,” as she affectionately calls him, what Achilles was
among the Homeric Greeks. Like Achilles, he was a fine soldier, but,
like not a few soldiers of Byzantium, he was also a student and a writer,
who composed his history at the command of that “most learned mind
and intelligence” as he called his wife’s mother, the Empress Irene<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>. Of
that lady her daughter writes with enthusiasm, comparing her with
Athena, and praising her for her zealous study of the branch of science
which was most appreciated at the Byzantine Court—dogmatic theology.
The Empress, so her daughter tells us, did not like publicity; she
preferred to stay at home and read religious books; and, when she was
obliged to perform any Court function, she blushed like a girl<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>.</p>

<p>Of her <i>fiancé</i>, the young Constantine, the Princess writes with an
enthusiasm which seems to come from the heart. She describes him as
“a living statue,” and says that “if any one merely looked at him, he
would speak of him as a descendant of the fabled age of gold”; and she
confesses that after all these years the memory of this youth filled her
eyes with tears. To the beauty of his mother, the Dowager-Empress
Maria, by whom she was in part educated, she has dedicated a glowing
passage, in which she likens her to a cypress in stature, with a skin
white as snow—in short, a statue such as neither Phidias nor Apelles
ever produced, “for such a harmony of all the members was never yet
seen in any human body.” Thus, the Court circle of the reign of Alexios
Comnenos, if we may believe his daughter, was a galaxy of that beauty
which modern society journals assume to be the attribute of royal ladies.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be imagined that Anna Comnena, because she
wrote like a Princess and a daughter, is not a valuable historian. She
possessed a first-hand knowledge of the events of a large part of her
father’s reign; and, as she tells us, she drew her information about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544"></a>[544]</span>
events, of which she had not been an eyewitness, largely from her
father’s fellow-comrades in war, men like George Palaiologos, the
defender of Durazzo, as well as from her father himself. Writing in the
reign of Manuel I, when no one was interested in flattering the long-dead
Alexios, she could claim, like Tacitus, that the time had arrived
to describe his distant reign “sine irâ et studio.” From her birth and
position, she possessed what mere scribes in all ages lack, an intimate
acquaintance with the men who are really making history. She knew
courts, and, a princess of the blood royal herself, she made the frank
admission that even her father, against whom there were constant
plots, was no exception to the rule that subjects usually dislike their
sovereigns<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>.</p>

<p>She had access to State papers, which to the ordinary literary man
would have remained inaccessible for generations. Thus, she gives us
the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the golden bull appointing the Empress-mother,
Anna Dalassene, regent in the absence of her son, and the text of her
father’s letter to the Emperor Henry IV, his “most Christian brother,”
urging him to attack Guiscard in Southern Italy, offering him money,
and suggesting a marriage between one of Henry’s daughters and his
own nephew. These curious pieces are of interest as a specimen of the
Byzantine Chancery’s epistolary style; and we note the care with which
the Byzantine Emperor, who regarded himself as the sole heir of all the
Cæsars, avoided giving the Imperial title to this Western “brother,”
whom Anna describes by the Latinised form <i>rex</i>, while reserving for
her father the more dignified title of <i>basileús</i><a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>. She gives, too, the full
text of the lengthy agreement made between Alexios and Bohemond in
1108, which she probably had from her husband, who negotiated that
treaty—a document of much value for the historical geography of the
Holy Land during the Latin domination<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>. She has apparently used for
her account of Guiscard a now lost Latin Chronicle, perhaps the work
of the Archdeacon John of Bari, which was employed by William the
Apulian as material for his Latin poem on that Norman chief, for she
quotes the envoy of the Bishop of Bari as having described to her an
incident in the campaign of Guiscard, at which he was present<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>.</p>

<p>She had access, also, to the simple and unvarnished memoirs of
retired veterans, and was therefore well posted in military affairs. Her
accurate use of technical military terms would do credit to a war-correspondent
of the scientific school, while the glowing rhetoric of some
of her descriptions would win the admiration of the modern descriptive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545"></a>[545]</span>
writer, who, not being allowed to see anything of the operations, has to
fall back upon the scenery. As examples of her military phraseology<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
may be cited the words ἐξώπολον for the circle outside the camp, κοπός
(or σκοπός) used in soldiers’ slang to designate their “fatigue parties,”
and ἀρχοντόπουλοι, a term originally applied to the corps of soldiers’
sons first formed by her father, but extended in modern Greek to mean
the children of any notables. She twice uses the technical term for a
galley, and gives an elaborate description of the cross-bow, then an
unknown weapon to the Greeks. More interesting still, she allows us to
read, imbedded in her severely literary Greek, occasional specimens of
the vulgar idiom used by the ordinary people in their conversation.
Thus, she has preserved the popular lines about the successful conspiracy
which placed her father on the throne; she cites a satiric verse about him
during the Cuman war, and alludes to the comic song, sung in the
vernacular, during the conveyance to execution of Michael Anemas,
who had tried to kill him<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>. She so far forgets the dignity of historical
narrative as to perpetrate two atrocious puns.</p>

<p>We find in her pages, too, some of the modern geographical names
which had already, in popular speech, replaced the classical denominations
for various Balkan mountains, rivers and towns. Thus, like her
husband, she uses the modern name “Vardar” for the famous Macedonian
river, instead of the classical “Axios”; she calls the Homeric “Ossa” by
its present title of “Kissavos”; she describes the poetic “Peneios” as the
“Salamvrias,” and uses the contemporary term “Dyrrachion” (whence
comes the modern Italian “Durazzo” and the modern Serbian “Dratch”),
as well as the older form “Epidamnos.” She apologetically asks no one
to blame her for using such a vulgar name as “Vojussa,” with which
the war has made us so familiar, for the classic river “Aoos<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a>.”</p>

<p>As a rule she adopts an exaggeratedly lofty style. Just as it was said
of Dr Johnson, that he would have made “little fishes talk like whales,”
so the learned Princess makes a man address a crew of boatmen in the
language of Homer<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>. Her contemporary, the annalist Zonaras, says of
her that “she employed an accurately Attic Greek style,” and that “she
had applied herself to books and to learned men and did not merely hold
incidental converse with them.” But she frequently descends to quite
every-day words, with which students of such mediæval Greek works
as the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i> and of the ordinary language of to-day
are familiar. Thus, she describes an army, just as the Chronicler described
it, as φοσσάτον; the French forms “liege” and “sergeants” are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546"></a>[546]</span>
scarcely disguised under her Greek renderings λίζιος and σεργέντιοι.
The classic word for “plains” (πεδία) becomes, in her prose, κάμπαι; the
poetic τέμπη assume (as in Attaleiates) the guise of κλεισούραι, while
κουλᾶ thrice displaces the classic ἀκρόπολις; φάμουσα, the vulgar word
for “libels,” has crept into her pages; and πιγκέρνης has supplanted
οἰνοχόος as the term for the court butler<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>. She remarks that those
who led a nomadic life were called in “the common dialect, ‘Vlachoi’”;
she quotes the popular Byzantine <i>mot</i>, that “the Scythians (<i>i.e.</i>
Cumans) missed seeing May by a single day,” because they were
defeated on April 29, and makes her father, when Bohemond at first
rejected his presents, humorously apply to himself the current
saying, “Let a bad thing return to its own master” (αὐθέντην)<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of Anna Comnena’s history is
the aspect which the First Crusade assumes in her pages. To Western
historians the Crusades appeared as, on the whole, a great material
benefit to Europe, quite apart from their religious and moral motives
and results. But we learn from this Byzantine Princess, herself an eye-witness
of the Crusaders’ arrival in her father’s capital, how this religious
movement struck the Eastern Christians. The incursion of vast masses
of more or less undisciplined soldiers into the Byzantine Empire naturally
inspired alarm in the mind of its ruler, who feared—and the diversion
of the Fourth Crusade from the redemption of the Holy Land to the
capture of Constantinople three generations later justified his fears—that
the pilgrims might be tempted to occupy his territories on the way.
East and West rarely thoroughly understand one another; and the
mutual reproaches of bad faith, which Greek historians have flung at
the Crusaders and Latin historians at Alexios, were probably largely due,
as is usually the case when two different nationalities quarrel, to a
misunderstanding of one another’s mentality.</p>

<p>Alexios could scarcely feel reassured, when he heard that one of the
Crusading chiefs was that same Bohemond who had fought against him
in Thessaly, and whose father had sought a shadowy pretext to invade
his Empire and capture Durazzo, “the Metropolis of Illyricum<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>.” Anna
tells us what were the Emperor’s feelings when he first heard the news
of the forthcoming Crusade and the approaching advent of vast Frankish
armies. “He feared,” she wrote, “their attack, knowing their unrestrainable
dash, their changeable and easily influenced minds, and all
the other qualities, or concomitant attributes, of the French character....
For the French race is extremely hot-blooded and keen, and whenever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547"></a>[547]</span>
it has once started on any course, impossible to check.” She accused
the Crusaders of treating treaties like “scraps of paper” and of inordinate
love of lucre; “for the Latin race,” she wrote, “is in other respects most
devoted to money.” In her eyes these “barbarians,” as she called them
in the contemptuous language of a highly cultivated Greek, were
actuated by motives very different from the ostensible aim of freeing
the Holy Sepulchre from the Infidels. “In appearance,” she remarked,
“they were on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but in truth they wanted to
oust the Emperor from his throne and seize the capital.” She noticed
the sudden ups and downs of the French character, rapidly going from
one extreme to the other, and pathetically described how one cause of
her father’s rheumatism in his feet was the constant exertion to which
they subjected that patient monarch, by worrying him with their
requests all day and all night, so that he could not even find time to
take his meals<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>!</p>

<p>In these circumstances, it was perhaps hardly to be expected that
he should be very enthusiastic about taking an active part in the Crusade,
although he more than once ransomed captured Crusaders. Nor was his
enthusiasm increased by such acts of spoliation as the erection into a
Latin County and a Latin Principality respectively of Edessa, still
governed at the time of the Latin conquest by a Greek governor, and
of Antioch, which only fourteen years earlier had been nominally a part
of the Greek Empire. Again, no sovereign, and not least the ceremonious
Emperor of Byzantium, could have been expected to put up with such
an affront as that described by Sir Walter Scott after Anna Comnena,
when a boorish Crusading noble seated himself on the Emperor’s seat.
Yet Alexios took this unwarranted act of rudeness with great tact and
dignity, even though it had been accompanied by an insulting remark
about “a yokel remaining alone seated while so many nobles were
standing in his presence.” Indeed, he not only deigned to ask who this
unmannerly churl might be, but gave him some excellent advice,
derived from long personal experience, of the safest way to wage war
against the Turks. The arrogant Frank paid with his life at the battle
of Dorylæum for his neglect of the Emperor’s well-meant warning<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>.</p>

<p>The literary Princess was not, however, so far led away by her
national prejudices as to see no good in the Crusaders. She said of a
very good Greek horseman, that “one would have thought him to be
not a Greek, but of Norman origin,” so well did he ride. Indeed, the
incapacity of the French to fight on foot struck her so forcibly that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548"></a>[548]</span>
remarked: “A Frenchman on horseback is unrestrainable and would
ride through the walls of Babylon, but once dismounted he is at the
mercy of the first comer.” For that reason her father bade his archers
kill the horses of the Western cavaliers, for then the riders would be
helpless<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>. She specially eulogises the honesty of the Comte de St Gilles,
Isangeles, as she calls him, who “differed in all things from all the Latins,
as much as the sun differs from the stars<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>.” While she expresses the
horror felt by her fellow-countrymen at the Church militant as represented
by the fighting Latin clergy, armed with shield and spear<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>, in
her character of Guiscard, who did so much harm to her father, she
praises his courage and strategic ability, and her description of
Bohemond’s personal appearance is so detailed and so flattering that
it may have been prompted by a very feminine motive. “No such man,
whether barbarian or Greek,” she wrote of him, “was ever seen in the
land of the Greeks (for he was a marvel to behold and a wonder to be
narrated)<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>.” Of the warlike wife of Guiscard, Gaïta, she says with mixed
admiration and alarm, that “she was a Pallas, but not an Athena,”
skilled in battle but not in arts, and terrible when armed with her lance
and piercing voice.</p>

<p>Students of Balkan geography are no less indebted to Anna Comnena
than are historians of the First Crusade. Her pages are full of the names
of places, rendered household words to us by the events of the last seven
years. On this subject she had access to a very high authority, her
father, who possessed a minute knowledge of both coasts of the Adriatic
with their harbours, a list of which he sent to his Admiral, and with the
prevailing winds of that turbulent sea. Alexios was, in fact, an Adriatic
specialist, as he would be described in the jargon of to-day. No writer
on the historical geography of Durazzo could afford to neglect our author,
who minutely describes the origin, topography, and contemporary
condition of that famous town. She tells us that at that time most of
the inhabitants were colonists from Amalfi and Venice; and she describes
the walls of that now squalid little Albanian town as at that time so
broad that more than four horsemen could safely ride abreast along them,
while there stood a bronze equestrian statue over the eastern gate. She
talks of the old Bulgarian capitals of “Pliskova” and “Great Pristhlava”
(Pliska and Prêslav); she narrates the origin of Philippopolis, where she
herself had lived for some time; and she makes one interesting allusion
to the comparatively recent Norman Conquest of England in the
passage, in which she says that Bohemond was aided in his second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549"></a>[549]</span>
invasion of Albania by men from “Thule” (Britain)<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>, which she also
mentions as furnishing the Varangian guard. We know from a contemporary
British historian how glad the English exiles were to fight
in Greece against the Normans, and how Alexios built a town for them
at Civetot, the modern Guemlek, on the Asiatic coast near Constantinople.
We hear, too, how 300 of them defended Kastoria.</p>

<p>She uses the correct word <i>jupan</i> (or “count”) for the Serbian
chieftains<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>, but designates both King Michael (who was the first ruler
of Dioklitia to bear the royal title and whose dominions included
Scutari, Montenegro, the Herzegovina and the coast), and his son and
co-regent, Bodin, as Exarchs of the Dalmatians<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>. She mentions also the
contemporary “great” <i>jupan</i> of the other and inland Serbian state of
Rascia, the modern <i>sandjak</i> of Novibazar, Vukan, describing him as
“wielding the entire authority over the Dalmatians,” of whom she says
that, “although they were Dalmatians, still they were Christians.” It
is interesting to find in this passage that one of his nephews already bore
the name of Urosh, so famous in the later Serbian dynasty of Nemanja,
which etymologists derive from the Magyar word <i>úr</i>, meaning “lord.”
The identification of the Serbians with “Dalmatians” would tend to
prove the predominantly Serbian character of Southern Dalmatia in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries. She was acquainted, too, with the
pirates, who infested the mouth of the river Narenta, and whom she
twice mentions under the name of “Vetones.”</p>

<p>The name of the Albanians was known to Anna Comnena, as to her
predecessors, Attaleiates and Skylitzes, the first Byzantine authors who
applied it to that mysterious race. She notices the exclusive admiration
felt by the Albanians, as by the modern British school-boy, for physical
prowess, and remarks that in that country bodily strength and size were
the principal requirements that made a man a suitable candidate for
the purple and the diadem<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>. In the case, however, of that tall but inane
guardsman, Prince William of Wied, gigantic size was not sufficient to
ensure the loyalty of the Albanians. Anna Comnena is also the first
writer who mentions the existence of the Wallachs<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> in Thessaly, soon to
be called “Great Wallachia” by her successor Niketas, and “Wallachia”
by Benjamin of Tudela, at a place called Ezeva near Mount Ossa. Notices
of this kind are what make her history valuable to us rather than the
classical reminiscences, which to her and her contemporaries were
doubtless its chief merit. She complained of having to insert “barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550"></a>[550]</span>
names<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>,” which “befouled” her historical style, in her polished narrative,
just as some modern imitators of Cicero objected to employing
words for recent inventions unknown to the Roman orator. She cited
as an excuse the example of Homer, who disdained not to mention
the Bœotians and certain barbarous islands for the sake of historical
accuracy. Fortunately, the more plastic Greek language is usually quite
equal to this difficulty, and even the uncouth names of French Crusaders
and Serbian <i>jupani</i> are admitted to the honours of the Greek declensions
by this skilled writer, of whom a contemporary said that, if the ancients
had known her, “they would have added a fourth Grace and a tenth
Muse.”</p>

<p>The time has come when it is no longer the fashion to decry Byzantine
history and to deny the name of literature to the writings of the
mediæval Greeks. Finlay rehabilitated the Byzantine Empire from the
contempt which Gibbon had thrown upon it; in Greece a succession of
modern writers, beginning with Paparregopoulos, in his great <i>History of
the Hellenic Nation</i>, have reminded his countrymen that Greek history
is a whole, and that contemporary Hellas owes as much, or more, to
the great figures of the Middle Ages as to the heroes of classical antiquity;
in France MM. Schlumberger and Diehl have combined, in truly French
fashion, great erudition with great literary skill in dealing with the
“Byzantine epic” of the tenth and eleventh centuries, and with the
female figures that in various ages filled the Court of Constantinople.
Of these Anna Comnena is perhaps the most curious. We are too much
accustomed to regard Byzantine personages as merely so many stained-glass
portraits, all decorations and angles, instead of men and women
of like passions with ourselves. Anna Comnena was, in her loves and
her dislikes, her vanities and her ambitions, very much a woman.
Beneath her Attic prose, acquired by study and polished by art, there
transpire the feminine feelings, which lend a peculiar turn to her history.
Among the sovereigns, lawyers, statesmen, soldiers, and ecclesiastics who
form the <i>corpus</i> of the Byzantine historians, she is the only woman.</p>

by Saint-Sauveur (<i>Voyage Historique, Littéraire et Pittoresque</i>, <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> 339) to have come
in with the Tocchi, and to be derived from the black image of the Virgin in the
cathedral at Toledo. It occurs, however, in a Neapolitan document of 1343, a
Venetian document of 1355, and a Serbian golden bull of 1361 and is mentioned in
the French version of the <i>Chronicle of the Morea</i>, probably written between 1333
and 1341. It has now been officially superseded by the classic Levkas.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_425" href="#FNanchor_425" class="label">[425]</a> Greek mediæval scholars, owing to the disturbed political conditions, have
scarcely had time since Salonika became Greek to continue the historical studies of
Tafel, Papageorgiou, and Tafrali—for even the last composed his two valuable
treatises on the topography of Salonika and its history in the fourteenth century
early in 1912, therefore before the reconversion of the mosques into churches and
while the city was still Turkish. But the well-known mediævalist. Professor
Adamantiou, has already written a handbook on Byzantine Thessalonika, Ἡ Βυζαντινὴ
Θεσσαλονίκη (Athens, 1914); M. Risal has popularised the story of this “Coveted
City,” <i>La Ville convoitée</i> (3rd ed., Paris, 1917); K. Zesiou, the epigraphist, has
examined the Christian monuments; the late Professor Lampros published “eight
letters” of its Metropolitan Isidore, who flourished towards the end of the fourteenth
century; and K. Kugeas has edited the note-book of an official of the archbishopric
who was at Salonika between 1419 and 1425, a few years before its conquest by the
Turks. See Πρακτικὰ τῆς ... Ἀρχαιολογικῆς Ἑταιρείας τοῦ 1913, pp. 119-57; Νέος

upon whose notes this book was based, may from theological bias have exaggerated

a celebrated case of brigandage.</p>
